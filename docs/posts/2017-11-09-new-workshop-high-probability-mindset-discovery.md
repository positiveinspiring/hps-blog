This is new material, never offered in a workshop before.  The focus is on the mental side of High Probability Selling (HPS).  Things like attitudes, beliefs, habits, concepts, principles, guidelines, and language.  We call this the *mindset* of High Probability Selling.


We recommend this course for people who are just beginning with HPS (and have read the book at least once) and also for those who have had some training.


The course is presented by Paul Bunn and Carl Ingalls.  It consists of 3 sessions, each about two hours long, and spaced one week apart.  Sessions are conducted by teleconference, and are live interactive conversations.  We record each session and make the recordings available to the participants.


We interview each applicant by telephone before accepting them as a student.


**Price:**  $255 USD per person.  We accept PayPal and most major credit cards around the world.


**Dates:**  Three consecutive Tuesdays.  The first session is Tue 21 Nov 2017\.  The second and third sessions are on Tue 28 Nov and Tue 5 Dec.


**Time:**  7:00 pm to 9:00 pm, USA Eastern Time (same as [New York City](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/usa/new-york)).
