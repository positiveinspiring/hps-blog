**Question**


Now that COVID has passed, do you think that it is better to have appointments in\-person face to face, or to continue with Zoom or Google Meet?


**Answer**


If you are a believer in having to have a meeting at all to sell, then either way will work. For example, if you (the salesperson) insist on meeting in person and the prospect is 500 miles away, then Zoom starts looking better for most people.


I have learned that where or how the appointment is conducted doesn’t matter much to me or my prospects. But that’s because, long ago, I gave up the traditional sales strategy that getting the most appointments equals the most sales, in person or otherwise.


The difference is in the conditional commitment level of the prospect towards something they want and I can provide, and the agreed upon purpose of the appointment or meeting if desired.


I don’t need an appointment to sell. I need a high probability prospect who is ready to buy if I can meet their requirements. Quite often, prospects prefer to buy without an appointment at all.


For a lot of buyers, a sales appointment is a waste of time, and it gets in the way of doing business for them.


The problem is that almost no salespeople bother asking IF the prospect wants to meet in the first place.
