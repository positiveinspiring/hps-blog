In trying to learn what we now call the High Probability Selling Paradigm, I found that it works to understand how most people think and/or intuitively react.  Security and Reliability are the most important motivations of most people who are ready, willing, and able to satisfy a need that they have.  That is usually expressed as:


* I have a problem or need and I know the value of solving it now.
* I don’t want to learn how, or to do it myself.
* I want a reliable solution that will solve my problem.
* I don’t necessarily want the best product or service available.
* I just want something that I’m sure will work.
* I don’t want to be sold on what I already want or to be confused.
* I want to deal with someone I trust and respect.


We call those people “High Probability Prospects.”  They make up 0\.5 to 2 percent of the market for most products and services. An efficient way to find them is to make prospecting offers to a highly targeted prospecting list.
