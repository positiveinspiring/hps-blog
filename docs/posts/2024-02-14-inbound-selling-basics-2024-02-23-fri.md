Paul and Carl, 


Nothing but positive feedback for your Inbound High Probability Selling Course. 


Since reading the book a few years ago I’d been piecemealing some of the practices together from the original Essence of High Probability Selling class, community forums, and blogs. Now I feel like I have a much firmer grasp on the mindset and the methods of high probability selling.


I’ll admit, going into the class I thought it would be more of a marketing focus on how to generate inbound calls. I’m really glad it wasn’t. As a Real Estate Broker, the activities I’ve always focused on are taking and selling more listings which requires talking to a lot of people. Most inbound calls I’d get were sign calls, calls from listing ads online, and the occasional return call from a voicemail. By working on the “get” for my scripts during your course and the inbound call framework I’ve doubled down on my outbound calls to get more signs in the ground (listings) and can now confidently handle those inbound calls by being an actual person on the other end of the phone. 


The focus on inbound calls was extremely valuable for me. My business comes from mostly outbound dialing, so when I’d get an inbound call, I’d find myself freezing and trying to figure out what to say to shift the control of the call back to me. I didn’t realize it but the fear of not knowing what to say had me searching for all sorts of methods to avoid them (recorded messages, call routing, no yard signs, not leaving voicemails etc.). It was simple all along…”How can I help you?” And listen, without trying to sell anything. That simple question along with the qualifying questions you laid out was the two\-millimeter shift that I needed to simplify my business. I’ve gotten rid of all the gimmicks just to “scale” which can sometimes be a fancy word for avoidance. 


Thanks again. I’m looking forward to future courses, continuing to improve, and working towards BEING High Prob. 


Very best regards,


**Blake**
