This is an overview of the things we *Believe In*, the fundamental beliefs at the core of High Probability Selling, the things we stand for.  Our best customers are the people who share our deepest beliefs.


* Everyone deserves dignity and self\-respect.
* Honesty really is the best policy.  It is the most reliable strategy for real success.  People who believe this strongly enough *make it true*.
* There is abundance in the world, and you will find it if you know how to look.
* Authenticity is about being what you believe in, not merely acting it out.
* Success comes from providing value.  We define value as what other people want.
* Observation overrules logic.  An idea does not have to be logical to be true.  Sometimes the things that work best don’t make sense at first.
* It’s not magic.  Ordinary people can learn and copy what the most successful people do.  No special mysterious talents are required.


We thank Simon Sinek for his TED talk on [How great leaders inspire action](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html), which inspired us to feature “What We Believe In” as a category in this blog.
