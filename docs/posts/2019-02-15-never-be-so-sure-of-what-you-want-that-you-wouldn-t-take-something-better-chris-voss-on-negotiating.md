Chris Voss is a master of negotiating, and especially in hostage situations.  In this [You Tube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrs7HdhUjM), he explains many of his basic principles for negotiating successfully.  Paul Bunn and I saw a lot of parallels between the principles Chris Voss follows in a negotiation situation and the principles we follow in a High Probability Selling situation.


The video is titled “CEO Chris Voss: Negotiate Like Your Life Depends On It \| iConic Conference 2017 \| CNBC” and is a little over 33 minutes long.  The You Tube URL is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\=WKrs7HdhUjM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrs7HdhUjM)


I invite you to watch and listen to him speak, and then post your thoughts and comments on this blog.
