Giving advice can be tricky.  Even when people ask for it, they don’t always accept it—or act on it.  In a recent seminar (25 Sep 2025\) we explored **how to apply** the principles of High Probability Selling (HPS) when offering advice, so that the advice is more likely to be welcomed, considered, and used. 


We covered very specific examples of how to use HPS when delivering advice, both free advice and paid advice.


Here are a few of the key points covered.


The first principle is making certain that the recipient will value the advice enough to actually **want** to hear it.  The only way to know for sure is to ask.


Another principle is understanding that **pushing causes resistance**.  When you push your advice, even on someone who wants to hear it, they are less likely to accept it.  As an alternative, you could tell them what they **could** do, instead of telling them what they **should** do.  Our passion and strong opinions can get in the way here.


Remember, the advice giver is not the one who will have to live with what happens when the advice is followed.  When you make sure the recipient plays a major part in making the final decision without being pushed or even nudged, you provide far more value to the recipient, no matter what they end up deciding.


The full recording of the seminar is available.  Regular price is $50 USD.  A discount of $25 is available to members of our [HPS Community Forum](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/hps-community-forum-series/).
