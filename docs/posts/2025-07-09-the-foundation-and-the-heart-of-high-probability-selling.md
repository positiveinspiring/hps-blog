I asked ChatGPT, “What is the foundation of High Probability Selling, what is the heart of it, and what is the difference?”


Here is a summary of its answer.



> The **foundation** is the **mindset and belief system** that underlies all behavior in the HPS process.  The **foundation** is **internal**—your beliefs, attitudes, and approach to selling.
> 
> 
> The **heart** is the **core practice**—what makes HPS different in action.  The **heart** is **external**—the actual behavior and methods you use with prospects.
> 
> 
> Without the **foundation**, the heart of HPS could become just another technique for manipulation.
> 
> 
> Without the **heart**, the foundation remains a good philosophy, but doesn’t translate into real\-world sales behavior.
> 
> 
> Together, they form a system that is both **honest** and **effective**.
