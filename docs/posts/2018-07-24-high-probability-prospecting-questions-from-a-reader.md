I recently received an email with some questions about High Probability Prospecting.  The email appears below (in blue), with permission from the author, and my answers are included (in black and *italics*) after each question.

Hi Carl,


Thanks for teaching the methods of High Probability Prospecting and High Probability Selling. I was really excited when I read the blog, because I found an honest, respectful and profitable way of selling. Hence, I bought the book and 2 mp3 (Selling Financial Services and Chp 12 explained)


I have a few questions after listening though.


1. How many times should we call a prospect before we move on? In Selling Financial Services, Jacques said that he once called a company 27 times before he got their business. Is there an optimum number of times to call, or should we just keep calling them forever? (assuming they do not ask us to stop calling them)  

*My answer:  As long as they keep answering the phone and listening to your offers, call them forever, even if they always say no.* *If you leave an offer by voicemail, and you do not get a call back, then treat that the same as if they said no**.  If they ask you to stop calling, then stop.*
2. If the prospect do not pick up the phone, do we call them again in the same month until they pick up, or do we call them the next month?  

*My answer:  If no one answers, not even voicemail, then call again as soon as you finish your list, even if it is the same day.* *Try different times of day, and different days of the week.* *If you continue to get no answer at all (not even voicemail), then reduce your frequency of calling that number, from a couple of days to a couple of weeks to a couple of months and eventually never.  Remember that it is more profitable to call someone who always says no, than it is to call someone who never hears your offer.*
3. How many numbers should I be calling? Assuming I prospect 3 hours a day, as recommended in the blog. Also, do I change to a fresh list of numbers to call every year, every 2 years etc?  

*My answer:  We recommend that you start with a list of 500 numbers, and then add numbers as needed.  Do not remove anyone from your list just because time has gone by.  A “fresh” list is not as valuable as your list of people who continue to listen to your offers, even when they say no every time.*


Anyway, I realised I asked a lot of questions which might be in your training course. Hence, if you could just answer the first question, I would be very grateful. Thank you for your help.


Best regards
