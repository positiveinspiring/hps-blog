**Structure**.  There are 3 parts to a High Probability Prospecting Offer:


1. Identify yourself (full name) and who you represent (name of organization).
2. Identify what you are selling in this particular offer.
3. Identify one or two features about what you are selling.


After we present the offer, we ask, “Is that something you want.”  We do not count that as part of the offer.


**Guidelines**.  Keep these points in mind when creating a prospecting offer.


* Make the offer very specific.  Do not try to create an offer that covers everything you sell.  When a prospect says “no” to your offer, you need to have a different offer the next time you call the same prospect.
* Be factual and use neutral matter\-of\-fact wording and intonation.
* Use simple language.  Avoid jargon, even when you are certain that the prospect would understand it.
* No persuasion, no convincing arguments.  Do not include anything that sounds like a reason why the prospect should buy.
* Do not use the words “you” or “your” or “yours” in the offer.  The first time we refer to the prospect that way is when we ask the question after the offer.
* Be very brief and concise.  Use a maximum of 30 words in the offer, even if it means you have to use one feature instead of two.
* When you identify yourself, it is best to start with “This is”.  The results are better than if you say “My name is”.  We don’t know why.
* Don’t say “Hello” and don’t say “How are you”, unless the prospect says something like that to you first.
* Use your full name.  Never use just your first name by itself.
* For instance, “This is Jacques Werth of High Probability Selling.”
* When you identify what you are selling, make sure your wording is simple and easy to understand.  Also, it is better to make it clear what a customers gets from you (the “Get”), rather than saying something that you do.
* Use Features, not Benefits.  A feature is a concrete attribute that describes part of what you are selling, part of what the prospect gets immediately.  A benefit is a positive outcome that can happen later.
* A feature can be something that differentiates your product or service.
* A feature can be used to “paint a picture” of what you are selling, in a way that makes it more real or solid in the prospect’s mind.
* Use features to make your offer more specific.  Next time you call the same prospect with an offer for the same product or service, use a different set of features.


Having good prospecting offers is important, but it’s only part of the process.  How you use your prospecting offers is just as important.


Happy prospecting.

Previously, we recommended a maximum of 45 words in the offer, and we also recommended two features in each offer.  We now believe this makes the offer far too long, and we now recommend a maximum of 30 words in a High Probability Prospecting Offer.  Shorter is usually better, even if it means that you have to use only one feature instead of two.


I have added several details to the guidelines that were not in the original post.  – *Ingalls*
