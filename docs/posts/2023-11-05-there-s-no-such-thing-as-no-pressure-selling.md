That’s what Todd Liles says in his blog post at [https://www.servextra.com/blog/sales/6\-keys\-to\-low\-pressure\-selling/](https://www.servextra.com/blog/sales/6-keys-to-low-pressure-selling/)


It makes logical sense, because if you believe that selling is about getting someone to buy, it is impossible to do that without applying some pressure. 


However, in High Probability Selling (HPS), we do not believe it’s about getting someone to buy. For us, selling is about finding people who want to buy for their own reasons, without any influence from us. We call that No Pressure Selling. 


However, we actually do apply pressure in one way. Although we don’t try to get the prospect to buy, we do try to get them to make a decision. We ask, “Is that something you want?” 


One way to sell with even less pressure than we do in HPS, is to be completely passive and wait for a sale to come to you. We don’t recommend that.
