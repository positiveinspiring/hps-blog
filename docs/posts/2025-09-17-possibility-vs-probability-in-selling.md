Most sales training is built around possibility.  If there is any chance that someone might buy, the salesperson is taught to keep pushing, persuading, and following up until something happens.  The thinking goes like this:  the more possibilities you chase, the more sales you will eventually close.


High Probability Selling takes a very different view.  Instead of chasing possibilities, we search for probabilities.  We want to know, right now, what the chances really are that someone will choose to buy from us.  If the probability is high enough, we continue the conversation.  If not, we set it aside and move on for now.


This shift changes everything.  Selling based on possibility is exhausting.  It means investing time and energy into people who may never buy, and who may only be willing to listen politely while you talk.  Selling based on probability is efficient, respectful, and freeing.  It allows both the seller and the prospect to be honest about what they want, without pressure or performance.


The difference is simple, but not small.  Possibility\-based selling keeps salespeople trapped in chasing.  Probability\-based selling sets them free to discover.
