It was 1995 when business owner Jerry Rubin became a student of High Probability Prospecting.  He immediately valued the course and it’s teaching, but admits to never quite working the program like he was taught.


“*I would make prospecting calls,*” Rubin shares.  “*But leads were scarce and hard to come by for my annuities business so I had a very hard time asking for a commitment.  I had a solid fear that I would burn the lead if I asked for one.”*


Little by little he “diluted” his opening introduction, moving further and further away from what he was taught.  He started asking *“is that something you’re willing to take a look at?”* instead of asking *“is that something you want?”*  Rubin admits that there were many times he drove hours to talk to a lead that was “willing to look at” his material and product, only to drive home empty handed and frustrated.


“*Everyone is ‘willing to take a look’”,* Rubin adds.  “*But there’s no commitment in that statement and all I was doing was wasting time and tapping dancing for low probability prospects.”*


Rubin’s “ah\-HA” moment came years later, and came in the form of a new employee.  As he trained his new hire he remembered the High Probability Selling system and realized the error of his ways.  This new realization was sharpened by the fact he was now *paying* someone else whether he was making a sale or not.  Rubin witnessed his new hire working HPS the way it should be, asking for commitments from prospects and getting them.


“*Getting a commitment took on whole new meaning, and the light bulb came on,”* Rubin adds.  He took over the reins and started using High Probability Prospecting the way it was designed; asking for the commitment from the leads that were being generated. He immediately saw results and reports he is getting a commitment from 80% of the prospecting calls he makes.


“*My ah\-ha moment helped me line up my internal parts and thoughts and enabled me to do what I should have been doing all along; asking for a commitment,*”** Rubin shares with pride in his voice.  “*There’s no way I am going back to my old ways.”*
