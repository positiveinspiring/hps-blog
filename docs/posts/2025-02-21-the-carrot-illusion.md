Do you ever feel that a prospect is leading you on, dangling a carrot in front of you to keep you hoping that they will eventually reward you with a sale? 


Did you ever ask yourself where that carrot came from and who put it there, really? 


You may think that the prospect is purposely teasing you. [One author](https://medium.com/@ossiana.tepfenhart/is-it-me-or-is-carroting-abuse-at-an-all-time-high-ed7a4c1c4871) calls this “carroting”. Others call it “future faking”. 


If you are so eager to chase an illusory carrot, can you blame them? 


But consider the possibility that this fake carrot may be entirely of your own making. Wishful thinking. Part of the fiction that you tried to create in the prospect’s mind. Only you fell for it, and they didn’t. 


There is a simple mirror that you can hold up to see if the illusion has any real substance. Ask the questions that you are afraid to ask. 


* Ask the prospect if they want what you are selling. If the answer is not yes, then let go. If they do say yes, find out more.
* Ask the prospect when they want this to happen. If it’s too far in the future, don’t spend any time on it now. Come back another time.
* Say what it will cost, and ask if the prospect is prepared to spend that. If the answer is not yes, well, you know what to do.
