What do you do when a prospect asks you to explain to them why they should buy from you? 


If you follow a non\-persuasive sales method like High Probability Selling, you would avoid getting drawn into that kind of a conversation. 


[Jacques Werth](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/about-jwerth/) taught his students to say, “*I’m not here to convince you,*” and then get right back to the question of whether the prospect wants what is being offered, or not.  He might also say something like, “*That’s not the way I work.*“


However, if the prospect has already said that they want the sort of thing you are offering, then it might be better to respond with the question, “*What matters to you?*”  And then, only address the things that matter to the prospect.  Keep it short and simple.  You either provide those things, or you don’t. 


And then you ask, “*What do you want to do?*“
