**One session, about 2 hours, led by Carl Ingalls.  $95 USD per student.**  Next workshop will be Tuesday 29 August at 1:00pm (USA Eastern Time, same [time zone as New York City](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/new-york)).


This is a review and discussion of all of the steps in the High Probability Selling process, with answers to participant’s questions.  It is recommended for people who have read the book at least once, and who want a better understanding of what they have read.


We will use the last chapter of the book, [*High Probability Selling*](http://www.highprobsell.com/book_hps/index.html "click here for info about the book") (written by Jacques Werth and Nicholas Ruben) as a guide for this workshop.  We will also discuss some of the details in the process that have been updated since the book was written.


The price is **$95** per person.  This covers 1 session, about 2 hours long, plus a recording of the session.  Conducted by telephone (teleconference, real\-time interactive), with questions and answers.  Led by Carl Ingalls.
