High Probability Selling demands that we stop trying to control others, and this goes against some parts of our human nature. 


We begin life as babies who manipulate people in order to get the care that we need.  It’s a natural survival tactic that works. 


As we mature, we gradually learn alternative ways of interacting, ways that are less manipulative and more cooperative, but we never completely let go of trying to control other people.  


And this can get in the way of being successful with High Probability Selling.  Even the most proficient practitioners occasionally find themselves drifting into old habits.  


The trick is to learn to recognize when we are drifting, and to have a way of getting back into the High Probability way of being. 


Different people have different ways of doing that. 


How do you manage it?
