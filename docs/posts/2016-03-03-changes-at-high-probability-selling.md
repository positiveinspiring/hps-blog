Jacques Werth has retired.  His company, High Probability Inc, is closed.


I (Carl Ingalls) have teamed up with two former HPS instructors (Paul Bunn and Neil Myers) to keep “High Prob” going.  We have all taught High Probability Selling in the past with Jacques Werth.


We are now offering individual coaching \[also see update below].  For details, contact Carl Ingalls, phone \+1 610\-627\-9030 (USA Eastern Time), [email](mailto:info@HighProbSell.com?Subject=Coaching%20in%20HPS) info@HighProbSell.com, or you may use the webform on our blog [Contact](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/contact/) page.


All posts and comments from the original High Probability Selling Blog have been copied to this blog and appear below.  There are a few points to note about these older posts:


* All blog posts now show Carl Ingalls as the author, but that is not quite correct for most of the older posts (2015 and earlier).  Most were coauthored with Jacques Werth, and a few were written by Paul Bunn and others.
* Contact information that appears in earlier posts is no longer valid. This includes phone numbers and email addresses.
* We may delete some of the older posts that are no longer useful.


The original website, [www.HighProbSell.com](http://www.HighProbSell.com), is still working, and is being maintained and updated by Carl Ingalls.

UPDATE (posted 2019\-01\-04 Fri by Ingalls):  

We now offer sales training in the form of group workshops, individual coaching, and consulting.  We also sell books and recordings.  Please visit the HPS website at [www.HighProbSell.com](http://www.HighProbSell.com) for more information and also for how to contact us.
