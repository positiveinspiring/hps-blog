Most salespeople are Go\-Getters. That is their basic attitude. They try to get an appointment with every prospect that might need what they sell. They try to get around gatekeepers. They try to get the prospect interested in their pitch by stressing benefits.

**Most salespeople are Go\-Getters.  That is their basic attitude.**


They try to *get* an appointment with every prospect that might need what they sell.  They try to *get* around gatekeepers.  They try to *get* the prospect interested in their pitch by stressing benefits.


When they meet, they try to *get* the prospect to like them.  They try to *get* the prospect to trust them.  They try to *get* the prospect to understand the value of what they sell.


They try to *get* the prospect to say “Yes” using various tactics of subtle persuasion.  They focus on overcoming every objection so they can *get* to the close.  If not, they try to *get* the prospect to continue the sales process.


**Most top sales producers are Go\-Finders.  That is their basic attitude.**


They *find* people who want what they are selling.  They *find* decision makers who are ready and able to buy.  They *find* a way to work with gatekeepers, not against them.


When they meet, they *find* out how much they trust the prospect.  They *find* any potential deal\-breakers as early as possible.  If they see a serious issue, they cut their losses and move on quickly.


In closing, they *find* out if each feature of their product or service will actually meet the prospect’s requirements.  To *find* the truth and not just get a “yes,”  they disclose all known disadvantages as well as the advantages.


The result is that the Go\-Finders find a lot more sales in a lot less time than the Go\-Getters can create.
