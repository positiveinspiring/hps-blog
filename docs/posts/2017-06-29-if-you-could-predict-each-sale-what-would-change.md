Suppose you had a crystal ball that will tell you who will buy from you and who will not.  What would you do with it?


Would you test it?  How?


How accurate would the predictions have to be in order to make a difference in how you spend your time and energy?


What would stop you?


I know the logical answers, and maybe you do too.  But I’m asking for your thoughts and feelings about this, because most of our decisions are based on our individual experience and gut feel.  Logic comes later, if at all.


What would you do?


\[Author’s note.  The crystal ball has only two answers:  Yes, or No.]
