Today, you need some appointments for the week and next. So you call your prospect list.


You’re polite and courteous with your introduction and you give your pitch.


They say it’s too soon after the holidays, and they’re too busy right now.


You explain why now is much better than later and persist in making an appointment…after all it will only take 20 minutes…just so you can establish a relationship… Everyone says to sell the relationship first.


You make it seem as reasonable as you can; they mention how the economy is bad and they don’t want to do anything new right now.


You acknowledge their concern, and you persist in trying to set an appointment.


After all, you’re just trying to help them, maybe save them some money…if they would just give you 20 minutes, then they would see the value that you provide.


Finally, they relent and ask you to send them a brochure, which they will seriously consider and then get back to you.


You offer to bring it to them on your way home from the office.


They tell you they’ll be out running errands then so just put it in the mailbox, then they say “Thanks, and then goodbye”.


With all the hope you can muster, you drop it off in their mailbox on your way home.


Of course, nothing ever comes of it.


If everyone says to do it that way, why doesn’t it work?
