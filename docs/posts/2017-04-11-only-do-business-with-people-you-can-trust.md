Obvious advice, but the hard part is deciding to follow it.  There are so many reasons not to.  Here are a few:


*(Author’s note, for clarity.  Why I might decide to do business with someone I don’t really trust.)*


* I can’t afford to be picky – there aren’t enough choices out there.
* I don’t trust any of them, so what difference does it make.
* I trust everyone.
* I don’t trust my ability to make decisions about trusting people.
* They offer the lowest price.
* They are the most convenient to work with.
* I’ve been doing it my way for a long time, and nothing really bad has happened so far.
* I’m smart enough to outsmart them, and I know how to keep from being cheated this time.
* I enjoy taking risks.
* I don’t want anyone to think I don’t trust them.
* I am afraid of making a wrong decision about this. (from a comment by Steve Alexander)


There is value in putting your finger on exactly why you don’t want to do something.  You have to accept it for what it is, before you have any hope of changing it.  And even then, it can be a long process.


If you can think of more reasons you might decide to do business with someone you can’t really trust, please add them in the comments.  Thank you.
