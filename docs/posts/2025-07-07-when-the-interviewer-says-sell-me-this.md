Suppose you are applying for a sales job, and suppose you are a practitioner of High Probability Selling (HPS). 


What would you do if the interviewer told you to sell them their laptop? 


Here is a clever and entertaining situation and response found on Tumblr: 



> I was at a job interview today when the manager handed me a laptop and said: “*I want you to try to sell this to me.*“
> 
> 
> So I put it under my arm, left the building and went home. 
> 
> 
> Eventually he called me and said: “*Bring my laptop back now.*“
> 
> 
> I said: “*$200 and it’s yours.*“


Here is a response that I believe is a little more consistent with the principles of HPS, although not as entertaining. 



> Applicant: “Do you want this laptop?”
> 
> 
> Manager: “No.”
> 
> 
> Applicant: “Ok. I only sell to people who want what I am offering. Since that’s not you, I’ll find someone who wants it.”
> 
> 
> Manager: “Convince me. Talk me into it.”
> 
> 
> Applicant: “That’s not the way I work.”
> 
> 
> Applicant: “What do you want to do?”
