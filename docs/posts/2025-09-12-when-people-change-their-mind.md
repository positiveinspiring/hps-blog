Dr. John C. Maxwell listed 4 “seasons” about when people change, as he explained in this *[YouTube video](https://youtube.com/shorts/v2j2W_e2UZ8?feature=shared)*. Note that he called them “seasons” and not “reasons”.


1. When they hurt enough that they have to
2. When they see enough they’re inspired to
3. When they learn enough that they want to
4. When they receive enough that they are able to


There is nothing in his list about someone convincing them to change. I don’t know why he skipped that one, but I can guess. Perhaps he didn’t think it happened enough to matter.


I also noted that three out of his four points have nothing to do with pain, problems, or need. Only the first one.


Maxwell seems to say that change comes from within each individual, and only when they decide that they are going to change. That fits very well with the thinking behind High Probability Selling.


We do not try to make someone change. We don’t even try to influence someone’s decision to change.


We just want to be there when they do decide to change. 


It’s all about positioning. Being in the right place at the right time.

We would love to hear your thoughts on this. For instance, why do you think Maxwell called them “seasons” instead of “reasons”. You are welcome to leave a comment or reply on this blog post.
