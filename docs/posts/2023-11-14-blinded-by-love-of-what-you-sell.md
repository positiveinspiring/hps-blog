Be careful when selling something that seems like a “no brainer”. If the reasons to buy it are so compelling that it sounds too good to be true, this will raise suspicion in the prospect’s mind too often. No amount of logic will overcome that, and it is terribly frustrating to try. 


Also, your enthusiasm, even when sincere, is likely to come across like every other excited salesperson trying to push the prospect into a sale. 


There is a special *way of being* that is the ultimate goal of High Probability Selling. And this is how we avoid triggering that general sense of unease a prospect may feel about the salesperson. 


That way of being is naturally neutral and objective. No agenda and no attachment to the immediate outcome.
