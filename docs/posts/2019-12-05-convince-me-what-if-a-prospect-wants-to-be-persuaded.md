If someone asks you to tell them why they should buy what you are offering, you have a decision to make.  It’s time to decide if you want to do some persuasive selling, or not.


There are a number of reasons you might want to do this:


* You might want to go back and try that other way of selling, just to remind yourself of what it tastes like.
* You might be someone who loves persuading people, and you don’t get enough of that when doing High Probability Selling.  You just need to get it out of your system.
* You really aren’t sure yet whether you want to do HPS or not, so you do what has worked well enough for you in the past.


If you decide that you do not want to get involved in convincing someone to buy, here is an example of what I would do, based on what I learned from Jacques Werth.


* **Prospect**:  Convince me.
* **Me**:  I’m not willing to do that.
* **Prospect**:  Why not?
* **Me**:  That’s not the way I work.
* **Me**:  What do you want to do.


This article was prompted by a conversation I overheard recently in the [HPS Private Discussion Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HighProbSell/) on Facebook.
