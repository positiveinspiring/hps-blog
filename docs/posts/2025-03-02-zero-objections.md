This blog post is extracted from a Reddit thread titled, “Struggling to Overcome Sales Objections? Read This.”


At one point in the conversation I wrote, “I changed my sales paradigm over 25 years ago and haven’t had to overcome an objection since.” 


One person asked me:



> What are you doing differently to have zero objections in 20\+ years? I acknowledge the framework you went through is still in existence and I agree it is no longer relevant, but to say you don’t handle ANY objections seems unrealistic.  What are objections, really, in your opinion?


I responded with the following: 



> Before changing my worldview of selling, and whenever I slip back into trying to turn a prospect into a sale (I ain’t perfect), I had to handle plenty of objections.
> 
> 
> Objections are simply the reasons a prospect doesn’t want to buy, generally expressed when we are trying to get them to buy.
> 
> 
> Let’s be real, when you and I are shopping for a new car, we don’t list our objections in our minds UNTIL we encounter a typical sales situation. 😉
> 
> 
> Sales resistance is caused by selling or being sold in the way that it is usually done.
> 
> 
> Objections are really just resistance to being sold on a non\-mutually acceptable basis.  A defense system to counter being sold.
> 
> 
> Prospects buy in their own time and their own reasons.  And much of what we sell requires a real commitment to follow through on the purchase.
> 
> 
> So, the choice is between objection\-based selling or commitment\-based doing business.
> 
> 
> Do prospects have reasons that hold them back from buying?  
> Yes, we all do.  Are these reasons for objections or objections that need to be overcome by a salesperson?
> 
> 
> Not at all.  Because we can seek them out and respect them before they become a defense system.  It’s our way of being as salespeople that makes the entire context of objections necessary in the first place.
> 
> 
> I guess the real question is to ask our prospects if they feel the need to use objections at all?
