Dear Readers,


You are invited to join this week’s **High Probability Selling Community Forum** meeting (it’s free):


**It’s Not the Words; It’s the Intention Behind Them**


In his article *“Poison Words: The Top 6 Words that Sabotage Sales,”* **Jacques Werth**, founder of High Probability Selling, described how certain words — like *Interested, Help, Honestly, Just, Thank You,* and *Great* — can create mistrust when used in traditional selling.


But as we’ll explore together, the real issue isn’t the words themselves — it’s the **intention** behind them and how we use them.  
When we use words to influence or control, even harmless phrases can become “poison.”  
When we speak truthfully and respectfully, even ordinary language can create a safe place for connection and trust to develop naturally.


We’ll talk about:


* How intention shapes communication more than vocabulary
* When some of those “poison words” might actually work with HPS
* How to recognize and change subtle patterns in your language
* How to de\-militarize the language of sales and align words and metaphors with genuine respect


**Two sessions will be offered this Thursday, October 23, 2025 (tomorrow):**


* 🕤 **9:30 AM** (USA Eastern) — hosted by **Carl Ingalls**
* 🕡 **6:30 PM** (USA Eastern) — hosted by **Paul Bunn**


Each session will last one or two hours.  You’re welcome to attend either or both.  They will be different. 


**Recordings.**  Both sessions will be recorded.  Both recordings will be made available to everyone who attends either session (and provides a name plus email address).  If you are not sure that you will be able to attend, you may request the recordings in advance (by Thursday night at the latest). 


**Join the Forum via Zoom:** (it’s free, no need to register, just show up)

*(Same link for both sessions.)*


We look forward to another thoughtful and authentic conversation on the principles that make High Probability Selling work.
