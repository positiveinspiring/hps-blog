President, High Probability Selling


When the first thing out of a prospect’s mouth is “How Much Does it Cost?” how do you respond?


We get a few calls a day from people who ask the price of our sales training courses. Here is how we respond.  

   

Do you want training for a single individual or a group?  

   

Do you want the interactive Instructor Led Distance Learning Tele\-Classes, or on\-site classes, where you can look at an instructor in front of the room?  

   

Do you want just the High Probability Prospecting course, which consists of nine, 90\-minute sessions? Or do your want the entire course including both High Probability Prospecting and High Probability Selling, which consists of twenty\-one, 90\-minute sessions?  

   

*Note: We do not deviate from the discussion of price, but we do ask questions that focus in on what the prospect wants.*  

   

By that time, over 60% of the people who called about price are asking a lot of questions about how the courses are conducted, how much can they expect to retain and utilize, how much memorization is required (none),what kind of results can be expected, etc.  

   

Very early in the conversation we get most call\-ins to go to our website (almost 40% are already there) and click on the "sales training" pages where the pricing options are clearly delineated.  And, we answer their questions without trying to "build value."     

   

Our closing rates are very high.  

   

The name of our company is "[High Probability Selling](http://highprobsell.com/index.html)." That means we do not do what we believe is logical, reasonable and really should work. It means that, we keep statistics, we know what works best, and that is what we do.


Do you want to hold on to your beliefs about what should work in selling, or do you want to learn, and gain the skills to utilize, what really works?
