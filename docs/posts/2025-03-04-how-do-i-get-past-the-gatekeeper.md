**Answer**



> The key to dealing with gatekeepers in a productive way is MUTUAL respect, which means you have to respect them FIRST.  No matter how convincing it may seem, DO NOT lie or try to sneak past a gatekeeper.  Gatekeepers are continually trained up by our competition on every clever, logical, trick or tactic out there and they have every right to shoot it down or block it.  Tactics are inherently disrespectful.  If you can work WITH them instead, you will be the only one who is never blocked.
