The book, *High Probability Selling*, describes a way of selling that is an effective alternative to the usual way of selling. 


The book tells the story of a salesperson learning this sales method on the job. It is a good illustration of what the process looks like, but does not go deeply enough for most people to learn how to use it as well as they’d like. However, it can help the reader decide whether they want to learn more, or not.

Here is the Introduction from the book:



> Why doesn’t sales training work?
> 
> 
> Why is it that most people who attend sales training courses and seminars show very little sustained improvement?  Why doesn’t modern sales training consistently produce successful salespeople?
> 
> 
> Why is it that most sales training courses and seminars contain large doses of motivational psychology?  Why is it that the sales profession is the largest user of motivational training?  Is it coincidental that the next largest user is the armed forces?  What is it that the armed forces and salespeople have in common that requires them to be the largest users of motivational training?  How many carpenters, mechanics, CPA’s, claims adjusters or veterinarians need to attend motivational seminars in order to do their jobs?
> 
> 
> How many professions come with a built\-in fear of rejection and a reluctance to do the job?  Why do approximately eighty percent of the people who enter the selling profession leave within the first few years?  Why do so many who remain feel trapped or burned out in their jobs?
> 
> 
> Why do most people try to avoid salespeople?
> 
> 
> Is this all endemic to selling or is there something fundamentally wrong with the way we sell that causes these problems?  Could it be that “Selling as the Art of Persuasion” is a concept whose time has come and gone?  Could it be that it’s no longer profitable to persuade and convince prospects to buy what they don’t already want?
> 
> 
> We maintain that persuading and convincing is no longer a viable selling strategy.  Even worse, the attempt to do so causes too much tension, stress, and frustration.  Therefore, we re\-invented the selling process.
> 
> 
> Everything’s changed.  All the rules are different.  Fear of rejection is no longer an issue.  Resistance disappears.  Relationships of mutual trust and respect develop naturally.
> 
> 
> Self\-esteem is a natural result of the process.  Salespeople have standards.  Who they are as people and who they are when they’re selling no longer have to be different.
> 
> 
> High Probability Selling trains salespeople how to discover whether there is a mutually acceptable basis for doing business without using manipulative techniques.  High Probability Selling is not an improvement on, or a variation of, any sales technique you know.  It’s a new paradigm that requires salespeople to sell with integrity in order to achieve outstanding results.
> 
> 
> High Probability Selling takes salespeople off their knees and puts them back on their feet, with dignity, where they belong.
>

**Here are a few comments from students of High Probability Selling:**


*“Life is too short and way too precious to waste it by selling any other way.”*


*“I used to sell to less than 25% of my prospects after 3 meetings. Now I sell to over 50% of my prospects in the first meeting. I used to be a salesman – now I’m an order taker. It’s almost boring.”*


*“HPS has changed my attitude about sales…completely. I cannot imagine selling any other way.”*


*“The principles of High Probability Selling have touched all aspects of my life. It is so valuable to be able to deeply relate to other people.”*
