Closing is hard when you try to find a way to qualify your prospects.


Closing is easy when your prospects will not allow you to disqualify them.



Closing is hard when you have to sell prospects on giving you an appointment.


Closing is easy when the prospect is ready to spend time and money to get a problem solved.



Closing is hard when a prospect is merely “interested”.


Closing is easy when a prospect wants to get answers to his or her problem.



Closing is hard when you have to push the prospect to buy.


Closing is easy when neither the prospect nor you feel any pressure.



Closing is hard when the prospect doesn’t know that he or she needs your product or service.


Closing is easy when the prospect already wants the benefits of your type of product or service.



Closing is hard when the prospect is not ready to decide.


Closing is easy when the prospect is ready, willing, and able to buy.



Closing is hard when you have to make the prospect do something.


Closing is easy when you realize that you can’t make the prospect do anything.
