> Hi Carl  
>   
> I absolutely support everything about HPS.  
>   
> You’re so correct, it is a mindset, if someone doesn’t get that it won’t work.  
>   
> My work in selling was as an Audiologist providing hearing healthcare, selling hearing aids with ongoing aftercare, it was totally the psychology of “finding people who want you’ve got” and dismissing (at that time) those who don’t.   
>   
> The mistake fellow Audiologists make is to find someone with a hearing loss and try to sell them hearing aids!!!  
>   
> Our sales managers want sellers to sell, I didn’t, however that could resulting in a typical 25\+% cancellation rate. I wanted to find those who wanted to buy and my consultation involved being confident to know the time was not now. I felt in control. I was a top seller and had a super low 7% cancellation rate, it would never be 0%.   
>   
> My sales manager picked on the 7% as a weakness to sell, “you could sell even more if you pushed harder” he said!   
>   
> I never had to cold call but my appointments were still somewhat cold so that was my starting point. 
> 
> 
> My first question was always   
> “why have you come to see me?” ie to put the onus on them straight away and then go on to find out if they wanted what I had and to know when to stop.  
>   
> Apologies if that’s a little rambling 🤣
