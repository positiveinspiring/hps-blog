It’s hard to put an exact number on how many people are actively searching for a less manipulative way to sell. But several trends make it clear that demand for a different approach is growing.


**Distrust of traditional sales tactics is high.**  
Studies show that 60% of B2B buyers question the integrity of salespeople, and only about one\-third find them genuinely helpful. Buyers want something more authentic.


**Top sales performers are less manipulative.**  
Among high\-performing salespeople, most rely little (or not at all) on manipulation. They succeed with honesty and transparency—and experience less stress while earning more trust from their clients.


**Honest marketing is in demand.**  
In a recent U.S. survey, nearly half of respondents defined ethical marketing as truthful and transparent messaging. Three out of four believe companies that commit to ethical marketing will be more successful over the long term.


**Even salespeople are speaking up.**  
On a public sales forum, one person summed it up:



> *“People love buying but hate being sold.”*


The shift is happening. Both buyers and sellers are moving toward authentic, respectful approaches to selling—ways that focus on the real probability of a sale rather than trying to force one into existence.


That’s exactly what High Probability Selling is all about.
