I’ve been giving expert technical advice for a long time.  However, my clients didn’t always take my advice, which means they didn’t get much value from hiring me as a consultant, and were less likely to hire me again.  After I learned High Probability Selling, I delivered my advice very differently, and that has made all the difference.
