Is it manipulation, or not?  Where is the dividing line?


It’s sort of like speeding.  No matter how fast you are going, you’re not speeding, but the guy going faster than you is.  Of course, anyone driving slower than you would say that you are speeding.


Same with manipulation.  Most salespeople will tell you that what they do is not manipulation.  They don’t cross that line, although others do.  In their eyes, it’s just influence and persuasion, a subtle nudge here and there, but not manipulation.  What they do is only manipulation in the eyes of someone who does it less.


Most salespeople know that pushing too hard is bad for business.  The question is, how little can you push, and still make sales?
