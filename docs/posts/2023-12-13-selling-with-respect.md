Respect the prospective customer’s right to decide what they want, without trying to change their mind. That is a major principle behind High Probability Selling. 


We want to find out *what* the prospect’s decision will be, not how to influence it. Since we estimate probabilities, we need to know what the truth really is, without our interference. 


Asking the right questions, in the right way, gets us a lot closer to the truth. 


For instance, we find that open questions work better than closed ones. Questions that give the prospect as much freedom as possible in how they choose to answer. It may take a little longer, but the response is usually more revealing.  


We give a lot of control to the prospect, and we do a lot of listening. That’s respect.
