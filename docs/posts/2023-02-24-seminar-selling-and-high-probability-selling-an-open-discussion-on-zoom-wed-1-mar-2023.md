Seminar Selling is when you make a presentation to an audience about what you offer, with the hope that some people will buy from you. 


We will talk about what happens when you combine High Probability Selling with Seminar Selling. 


We will use Zoom video conferencing.  The discussions will be led by Paul Bunn and Carl Ingalls. Recordings will be made available to participants only. 


We are offering this meeting twice, on Wednesday 1 March 2023, at 10am and again at 4pm ([USA Eastern Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/et)). No charge. 


If you want to attend, please send us your email address, and let us know which time.
