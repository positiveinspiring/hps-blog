HPS Community Forum – Thursday, September 18, 2025


In this session, we explored two core questions:  why do we try to change people, and what happens when we stop?


**Why do we try to change people?** 


* From childhood, we learn to manipulate others as a way to survive and get what we need.  Even as adults, it is hard to let go of those early strategies.
* Ego plays a role—we believe we know best.
* Often we don’t stop to consider alternatives.
* Many of us hold on to the belief that we *can* change others, despite evidence that it rarely works.
* Attempts to change others can also come from a sense of powerlessness.
* Sometimes it is rooted in good intentions:  wanting to help, fix, or rescue someone who appears to be struggling.


**What happens when we stop trying?**


* A sense of peace and acceptance emerges, since we are no longer pushing against the impossible.
* The effort required to interact with others decreases dramatically.
* We stop worrying about what to say next, and simply listen.
* Conversations become more relaxed and natural.
* We absorb and understand more from the other person.
