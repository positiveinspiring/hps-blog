The following is my favorite testimonial about High Probability Selling.



> This was by far the best workshop that I have ever attended.  I learned more practical concepts in this workshop than all the others combined.  I was very impressed with the amount of knowledge that was shared during the class.  I received so much more from the class than I had originally anticipated.  I was so pleased to learn that Jacques was teaching the class, there’s no better way to learn than getting it straight from the source.  The thing that was most astounding to me was how much the skills from High Probability Selling can be used in everyday life to better the interactions one can have with the people in their lives.  That was truly more than I had expected.  Since the closure of our workshop I was able to do a trust and respect inquiry on my Father (the man of few words).  In the 45 minute ride to the airport, my dad talked almost the entire way and I was truly amazed at how much I learned about my father that I never knew.  About the relationship he had with his father and how he was terrified of him.  It gave me so much insight into my father and why he behaves the way he does.  I gained a huge amount of respect for him and a deep love and appreciation for all that he has done for me.  Had I not learn how to do this, I would have never known what makes my father tick.  Thank you so much for teaching me this skill that will help my business and my life.  I will forever be grateful.  You have truly left footprints on my heart that will no doubt allow me to leave footprints on other’s hearts.  I hope all the talking I’ve done and will continue to do about your workshop sends you some new business!  Thanks again for everything!
