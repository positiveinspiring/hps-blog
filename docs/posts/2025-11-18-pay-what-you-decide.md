We are introducing a Pay What You Decide option for some HPS events. You choose how much to pay — and you do that for your own reasons.




 

For some of our upcoming High Probability Selling events, we are introducing a new flexible pricing option: **Pay What You Decide**.


We will describe the event (or product or service) as clearly as we can. After that, you choose what to pay. Any amount is acceptable, including zero.


Jacques Werth, the founder of High Probability Selling and coauthor of the book, often said:



> *“People buy in their own time, and for their own reasons.”*


People choose how much to pay for many different reasons. Some are practical, some are personal, and some are simply how they feel in the moment. The choice, and the reasons behind that choice, belong entirely to the buyer.


**Action Option:**
