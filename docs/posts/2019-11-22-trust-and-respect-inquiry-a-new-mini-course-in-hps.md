The next High Probability Selling Mini\-Course will be a short webinar session about the **Trust and Respect Inquiry**, on Tuesday 3 December 2019 at 1pm USA Eastern Time.  39 minutes  for $39


The *Trust and Respect Inquiry* (TRI), has also been called *Connecting* and *Getting Personal* in past HPS sales training workshops.  It is described in the HPS book, in the chapter titled “Establishing a Relationship”.


In HPS, we do not attempt to create or build a relationship.  We test it.  The TRI is a discovery process.  We want to find out what sort of a relationship is likely to form with a prospective customer, so that we can make better decisions about how we will proceed.


In other sales methods, the salesperson uses rapport\-building techniques to try to influence the prospect.  That is not our purpose, so we do things very differently.


This mini\-course includes a description of what the TRI is and how it is used, plus the basic principles and guidelines.  It does not include any demonstration or practice, and is not designed to teach someone how to do it.  Those things are covered in the full 3\-week workshop version of the material.


The webinar will be led by Carl Ingalls in real\-time (live).  Content is mostly audio (speaking), with some video (text, graphics).  The session will be recorded (audio and video, plus transcript), and the recording will be made available to everyone who signs up (and pays for) the mini\-course.  The recording of this session may be offered for sale later.


The webinar platform is GoToMeeting.  If you have not already downloaded and installed the GoToMeeting app on your computer or mobile phone, I strongly recommend that you do so at least 30 minutes before the webinar begins.  And even if you have the app and are already familiar with GoToMeeting, please note that they have changed their user interface quite significantly recently, so I recommend joining the meeting 5 or 10 minutes early.


The price is $39 USD per person.  However, I have 10 introductory discount coupons to give away, each $15 off.  If you want one, please contact me (Carl Ingalls) by phone at \+1 610\-627\-9030 or by email at [info@HighProbSell.com](mailto:info@HighProbSell.com) (before you click on the purchase link below).
