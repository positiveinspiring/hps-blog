The answer is maybe. High Probability Selling (HPS) might work extremely well for you, or it might not work at all, or it might work about as well as what you are already doing. If you want a better answer than that, you can fill out one of our free questionnaires.

The answer is maybe.  High Probability Selling (HPS) might work extremely well for you, or it might not work at all, or it might work about as well as what you are already doing.


If you want a better answer than that, you can fill out one of our free [questionnaires](http://www.highprobsell.com/compatibility/).  You will get an estimate of how well HPS is likely to work for you.


The questionnaires compare an individual’s attitudes and behaviors with the people who have gained the most from our sales training and also with the people who have not benefited from it.  These comparisons provide an estimate of the compatibility between the individual and what is required to be successful with High Probability Selling.


Our predictions are not perfect.  We still get some surprises, and a lot of them are pleasant ones.  However, we believe that an estimate of probability of success may be valuable for people who are asking whether HPS will work for them or not.


When people make better decisions about whether to take our sales training courses (or not), we also benefit.

We want to hear your feedback about these questionnaires.  Please leave a comment on our blog.


*Update (6 Jun 2012\):  Questionnaire \#1 is still free.  However, as of June 2012, the second questionnaire is no longer free.*
