So many things seemed so very important a few months ago.  Today, most of them are forgotten.


In a world where survival is threatened, is High Probability Selling still relevant?  Is it worth it for me to continue to teach this, and will it help in any way?


People still push each other around a lot, and when pushing doesn’t get them what they want, they push harder.  They’re too desperate to try anything new, and especially anything so radical and unknown as HPS.


The current COVID\-19 crisis has brought out the extremes in people.  All around me, I see bravery and generosity, by individuals and by corporations.  The opposite extreme exists, but is not as important these days.


So what can I do?


One answer is to reach out to people, see how they are doing.  It’s a little thing, but it may help us all in this time of social isolation.  I’ve been practicing with the video conferencing platform Zoom.us, so that I can connect with more people at once.


You are all welcome to my next video chat, which will be this Friday, 17 April, at 3pm Eastern USA Time (same as New York).  If you want to join me, please email me at [Ingalls@HighProbSell.com](mailto:Ingalls@HighProbSell.com) so that I can send you information on how to connect.  No charge.


Keep safe, and keep well.


Comments are welcome and appreciated.
