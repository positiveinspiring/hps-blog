High Probability Selling


Every salesperson has a great niche market that 99 percent aren’t even aware of.  The concept of a niche market is not new.  The meaning of the term is as varied as the number of sales, marketing and business people trying to identify, define or pursue a niche.  If you find the right niche, your sales volume will skyrocket.


A typical niche may be a group of millionaires that own helicopters, or an affinity group of retired doctors and lawyers, or large\-scale forested landowners.  The list is only limited by our imaginations and exposure to the worlds within the world around us.


There is one niche market, however, that exists for virtually every salesperson or businessperson out there.  And it is not defined by commonly used demographic factors.  It is a segment of nearly every market that goes virtually unnoticed, except by the best salespeople.


That niche is made up of prospects that, thanks to the information age, already want the benefits of your type of product or service.  If asked in an appropriate way, they would actually confirm that they want what you’re selling, and that they will do business with you if you can meet their requirements to do so.


These are their “psychographics”:


1. They’ve figured out why they want the benefits of your product or service.
2. They don’t need to be sold to.
3. They don’t respond favorably to persuasion, however subtle.
4. They don’t want (or need) to be educated about your offering.
5. They are not merely interested in what you’re offering.  They are ready to make commitments to do business.
6. One of the things that determines who they buy from is whether they trust and respect the salesperson they’re buying from.  Whether they “like you” is unimportant.


 They are out there. Right now.  In your market.  In your industry.  Hoping to encounter a salesperson that they can trust and respect, and do business with in a direct, open and transparent way.  You need a prospecting system that is designed to communicate in a way that allows them to identify themselves.  


Now you have options that are not just variations on the theme of selling as most people know it.


You can sell in a way that requires attempting to make people, most of whom aren’t buyers, into customers…or…sell in a way that requires finding the people that are buyers and making the determination of whether or not it is mutually beneficial to do business.


What do you want to do?
