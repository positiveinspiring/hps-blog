In High Probability Selling, we always accept “no” for an answer, and we move on.


Prospects say “no” in different ways, depending on circumstances.


For instance, suppose we are on a live phone conversation with a prospect, we present our offer, and ask “Is that something you want.”  They might answer our question with a simple “no.”  In that case, we say, “Ok.  Bye\-now.”  Then we pause a few seconds in silence, and hang up.


Or, they might say something like, “I’m busy.”  As far as we are concerned that is exactly the same as a “no.”  We do not ask when is a better time for us to call again.  We say, “Ok.  Bye\-now” and we hang up.


And if they say anything that sounds remotely like an objection, that’s the same as a literal “no.”


When we leave a message (by voicemail, text, or email), a lot of people say no by deleting the message without responding to it in any way.  If we do not receive any response from the prospect, we also treat that as a no.  We might say ok and bye\-now in our own heads.  But everything after that is the same.  We record what offer was given, and we call them back in 3 to 6 weeks with a different offer, just as if they had said no to our offer in person.


There is an exception to the above.  When we leave a message with a gatekeeper, and we are following the HPS special protocol for [Working With The Gatekeeper](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/2009/01/16/prospecting-and-the-gatekeeper/), we may call that same gatekeeper in a few days to ask about the response.


If a prospect does not say “Yes” to our question, “Is that something you want,” we have found that it is better to exit quickly and come back to the same individual 3\-6 weeks later with a different offer, than it is to spend any more time at all talking with that prospect.  That is why Jacques Werth advised students to err on the side of disqualifying a prospect.  You are far more likely to get another chance at discovering a sale by coming back later.


Most of the time, no only means not now.


Happy Prospecting,  

Carl Ingalls
