This sales training workshop on High Probability Prospecting begins on Tuesday 21 February 2017 and ends on Tuesday 25 April.  It includes 10 group sessions on 10 consecutive Tuesdays, plus 30 minutes of private coaching for each individual.


Group sessions begin at 9:00am USA Eastern Time (same [time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/new-york) as New York City).  Duration of each group session is 90 minutes to 2 hours.


All group sessions and private sessions are conducted by telephone and recorded, using our teleconference system.  Recordings are sent to the participants.


The price is $1050 USD per student.


High Probability Prospecting is how we find people who want what we are selling, and how we determine the likelihood of doing business with them.  It is a detailed process of how to contact people (reaching out), and how to respond to people who contact us.


The High Probability Prospecting process has been updated to reflect changes in the way people communicate, and especially in the way people use the telephone today.  There are changes in the details of what we do, but the fundamental principles are the same as before.


This workshop will be taught by Paul Bunn, with assistance from Carl Ingalls.
