We now have two different ways that people may subscribe to this blog, which makes things a little complicated.  I will try to explain this in a way that makes things clearer.


Think of it as two different levels for subscribing.  With either level, you will receive an email whenever a new post has been published here.  You will be able to cancel or change at any time.


The first level is Plain and Simple.  If you see a “Follow” button in the bottom right corner of this browser window, you can click on that, and then provide your email address.  If you don’t see that button, then your browser may need updating.


The second level will give you blog posts plus Special Content that is not posted on the blog.  We will need your name as well as your email address for this.  You may give us your phone number and company name if you wish.  We also give you more control over what kinds of blog posts you receive by email (see below for more details).


The first level is better for people who are very new to High Probability Selling, and who just want to watch for a while without giving us much information about themselves.


The second level is better for people who have been following High Probability Selling for a long time, or who want to interact with us more and receive additional material from us.  It’s a little bit more work for me, but it’s exactly the same amount of work with 10 people as it is with 1000\.  So please feel welcome.


If you received an email copy of this blog post from “hps\-blog@aweber.com on behalf of Carl Ingalls”, then you are currently subscribed at the second level.  If you received an email copy of this blog post from wordpress.com, then you are subscribed at the first level (“Follow”).  If you received copies from both, then contact me and let me know what you want to do.


We use opt\-in confirmation for all new subscribers.  This means that you will receive an email that asks you to confirm that you really do want to receive our emails.  When you click on the hyperlink in the confirmation email, then this will complete the subscription process.  If you do not click on that hyperlink, then your subscription will be ignored (not processed).


If you want to subscribe at the second level, which is the one that includes the special content, please contact Carl Ingalls, either by phone or [email](mailto:ingalls@highprobsell.com?Subject=Request%20to%20join%20email%20list%20with%20special%20content) (\+1 610\-627\-9030 or Ingalls@HighProbSell.com), and please include the following information (required info is shown in **bold**, and everything else is optional):


* **Your full name**
* **Your email address**
* Your company name
* Your phone number
* What kinds of blog posts you want to receive by email.  Choices are
	+ All blog posts (this is the default)
	+ Articles only
	+ Announcements only
	+ No blog posts (special content only)


Posts to this blog are categorized as either **Articles** or **Announcements**.  Articles are about selling methods and ideas and stories. Announcements are about what we are offering for sale:  sales training, coaching, teleseminars, and new product offerings.  **Special Content** will not be posted on this blog, and will be sent only to the people who are subscribed at the second level (not just “Following”).


**Privacy**:  We will not share your name or information with any other organization.


Updates to this information will appear on our [Subscribe](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/subscribe/) page.  You can also reach that page by clicking on the Menu button near the top right corner of this page (appears on the blog window as 3 horizontal bars).
