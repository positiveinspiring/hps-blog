How do you respond? 


First, this almost never happens.  If you are being authentic and sincere, the person you are interviewing will rarely question your motives. 


However, students of High Probability Selling worry about lots of things that almost never happen, and they need to have these “what\-if” concerns answered before they can move ahead. 


Here are two responses that are highly consistent with the principles and attitudes of High Probability Selling. 


**“I’m learning a new way of getting to know people.”**


**“This is how I get to know people.”**


Do not say, “I’m just curious” or anything else that trivializes what you are doing.

Asking personal questions is what we do in the Trust and Respect Inquiry, which is one of the more advanced discovery tools of High Probability Selling. 


This process is described in the book, High Probability Selling, in the chapter titled “Establishing a Relationship”.  For more on this topic, see earlier blog article, “[Establishing a Relationship – Revisited](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/2018/11/21/establishing-a-relationship-revisited/)“
