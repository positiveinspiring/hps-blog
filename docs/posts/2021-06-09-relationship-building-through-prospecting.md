We let relationships build themselves naturally from how we work and who we are being, nothing else.  We make no attempt to create a relationship. 


We demonstrate who we are every time we reach out to someone using the methods of High Probability Prospecting. 


* We get to the point quickly and directly.
* We accept No for an answer, without question, and we go away immediately.
* We do not try to influence or change anyone’s mind.
* We are selective about who we will do business with, and under what circumstances.
* We reach out to the same individual about once a month, with different offers.


These behaviors shape the relationship that forms, over time.
