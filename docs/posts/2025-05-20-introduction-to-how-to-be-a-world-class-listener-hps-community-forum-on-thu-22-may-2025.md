An interactive learning session presented by:  Nick Ruben, co\-author of “High Probability Selling” and author of “How to Be a World Class Listener”.   Nick was the original HPS workshop leader and has also trained companies and organizations in improving their listening skills for nearly two decades since.


In HPS, we often say that we are “listening our way to a sale” but we haven’t yet explained simply enough how to do that.  HPS has elements of focused listening in the Relationship Inquiry, which for many of us has been daunting.  Nick’s book helped us understand that great listening can be applied to all of HPS, not only in certain parts.


While this will essentially be an introduction, as Nick’s full course consists of an entire day, you will likely gain a deeper insight into what great listening is all about, as well as how listening relates to HPS and can improve your relationships in business and in life.
