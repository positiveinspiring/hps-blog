High Probability® Selling


Your attitudes, beliefs and emotions guide your tonality and manner of speaking. That’s one of the things we focus on in High Probability Selling.   




We describe the best attitude to be "neutrality." It’s where we treat the prospect with respect – but not deference. It’s what Eric Berne, author of “Transactional Analysis,” described as Adult\-to\-Adult Communications, and we describe as “non\-judgmental” or “neutral” communications. If your expectation for your relationships is Mutual Respect, your sales results can improve to an amazing level.   




It’s relatively easy to learn, and it can become the natural way for you to speak. If you focus on an attitude of neutrality while you are telephone prospecting or calling customers, you can quickly become someone who gets respect, automatically.
