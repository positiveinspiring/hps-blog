Discover the power of the **Inquiry Method**, a revolutionary approach for finding out what you really need to know about your prospects—before making any business decisions. Unlike typical sales tactics that focus on rapport\-building, the Inquiry focuses on creating an open, honest, and safe space for communicating.


Jacques Werth, founder of High Probability Selling (HPS), called this the Trust and Respect Inquiry (TRI). It remains one of the most valuable, yet challenging, elements of the HPS system. While some practitioners have mastered it with great success, many have encountered obstacles that prevent them from progressing.


This workshop introduces a new approach to the Inquiry, starting with the basics and gradually building towards mastery. You’ll begin by understanding the core principles and then practice a simplified version of the Inquiry, all while maintaining its essence. In the final module, you’ll learn how to embody the Inquiry mindset, allowing you to engage in these powerful conversations with ease, in any situation.


**Who Should Attend:**
----------------------


This workshop is designed to accommodate people with a wide range of backgrounds—whether you’re new to HPS or have years of experience.


* **New to HPS?** Module One is best if you have read the book but have not received any training in the Inquiry.
* **Previously trained (in the TRI) but not comfortable with it?** Modules One and Two will help you resolve the discomfort.
* **Struggle with applying the Inquiry in real\-world business settings?** Modules Two and Three will provide the practical skills needed.
* **Want something more authentic than rapport\-building?** Modules One and Two cover the what and how. Module Three gets into this more deeply.
* **Curious about the Inquiry for personal growth?** The Inquiry is a powerful tool for understanding colleagues, relatives, or anyone you want to connect with more deeply. We cover this in Module Three.
