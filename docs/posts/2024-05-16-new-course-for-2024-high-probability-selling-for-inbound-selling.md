**The Backstory: HPS and Inbound Selling**


Since the 1990s, High Probability Selling (HPS) has focused predominantly on outbound telephone prospecting, followed by a sales appointment or closing process. Despite the fact that Jacques Werth, one of the co\-authors of the HPS book, successfully implemented HPS in several businesses with primarily inbound traffic, the book and training did not cover how to handle inbound sales.


When I asked Jacques about applying HPS to inbound sales calls, he suggested, “just listen to them long enough to give them an outbound prospecting offer.” However, I found that this approach was ineffective and often counterproductive, frustrating both the prospect and me, as well as the referral source.


Through my own experiences, I quickly realized that the traditional HPS methods were not suited for inbound calls. Abandoning HPS was not an option for me, as it would create more chaos. Instead, I adapted HPS to fit inbound selling scenarios.


From 2010, over 13 years working in health insurance agencies and call centers that handled 95% inbound calls, I developed a new approach. I created what we now call “HPS in a non\-HPS world” for inbound selling. As I successfully applied these adaptations as an agent, I also trained, coached, and supervised others in implementing HPS for inbound callers.


**Why Adapt HPS for Inbound Selling?**


Outbound calls are straightforward; you know the topic, the offer, and the likely responses. However, inbound calls are unpredictable. You don’t know who is calling, why they are calling, or even if it’s a sales call. This unpredictability can unsettle even the most seasoned sales professionals.


Through trial and error, I learned how to listen effectively to inbound callers, determining if a sale was possible and if the caller was a High Probability Prospect (HPP). If they were not, I developed ways to gracefully lead them to an exit point while preserving the opportunity for future warm calls. This gentle and respectful disqualification is crucial for maximizing inbound call opportunities.


**Workshop Content**


This course will teach you how to handle inbound calls using the HPS framework. You will learn:


* **Common Pitfalls and Mistakes**: Identify and avoid common mistakes made during inbound calls.

* **Overcoming Salesperson Biases**: Recognize and mitigate preconceived ideas and beliefs that hinder understanding and connection.
* **Creating a Safe Space**: Make prospects feel safe to share necessary information for both their benefit and yours.
* **Maintaining HPS Mindset**: Balance qualification and disqualification while maintaining neutrality.
* **Implementing HPS Processes**: Design and implement written processes to handle inbound inquiries efficiently.


**Personal Insights and Strategies**


During the workshop, I will share personal anecdotes and strategies that helped me adapt HPS to inbound selling. You’ll learn:


* How to handle inbound calls confidently and effectively, maintaining the HPS mindset.
* How to design and implement HPS processes specific to your business needs.
