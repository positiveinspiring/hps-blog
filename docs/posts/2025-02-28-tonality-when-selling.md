Tonality is very important, and it can’t be faked consistently enough through an entire live sales interaction, without being based upon personal principles and a well thought out mindset.  There are quite a few instances when we tend to up\-speak, for example, which in a sales interaction can sow seeds of uncertainty and doubt, often without the salesperson realizing it.  A great example of tonality in speaking can be found here: <https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LpGIRhSZ3Jw>


One of the fastest ways to become aware of a tone that isn’t working for you, is to record yourself ONLY and then play it back and listen with your eyes closed.  Many people find their own voice playback to be uncomfortable, but if you can hang in there, you’ll immediately pick up and become very aware of the tonality changes that actually create negative reactions, conscious and intuitive, and you will also be able to intuitively fix them.


It’s not always about what you say, it’s about who you are being while saying it.  We often focus on what to say (next) and completely ignore how we say it.


For example, any excess or inauthentic enthusiasm, although espoused by many a sales guru, if it doesn’t reflect your natural conviction, will come off as fake or manipulative.  Listening to your side of a phone conversation will show that instantly.  Sales is a leadership process.  People are reluctant to follow leaders who sound fake.
