Highly effective sales producers make fewer sales visits.  They only visit the prospects that are most likely to buy from them.  They become more and more skilled at knowing the difference between buyers and “tire kickers”.  They also become very skilled at communicating with real buyers.


Salespeople that follow this strategy close more sales per month (on average) than those who make more sales calls.
