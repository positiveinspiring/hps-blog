Jacques Werth, MBA, was the founder and past President of High Probability Selling, a sales consulting and sales training organization.  Werth had observed hundreds of salespeople in many different industries while they interacted with prospects and customers.  He learned what the top 1% of the world’s best salespeople do that the other 99% do not do, and this is what he has documented in his book, *High Probability Selling* (coauthored with Nicholas Ruben), and has taught.


Jacques retired and closed his company at the end of 2015 and he asked me (Carl Ingalls) to take over.  I kept in contact with Jacques, and continued to learn from him over the next several years.


After a long decline, Jacques died on 15 March 2024 at the age of 88\.
