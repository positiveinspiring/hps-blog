Jacques,


Thank you very much for your time this morning.  In all honesty, before I called you, I was nervous that you were going to pressure me into signing up for a workshop.  Since I’ve already read your book I should have known that high pressure sales wasn’t your thing.


I’ve heard other sales trainers preach that you need to “remove the sales pressure” and “be yourself”, but they immediately turn me off because they start using high pressure tactics to get me to buy their stuff. You are the only person in this industry that I’ve met so far that truly practices what you preach.


Best,


Joseph
