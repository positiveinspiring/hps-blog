Most buyers prefer to do business with salespeople who pay attention to what they want.


Many salespeople want to sell by trying to get a potential customer to buy.  Their focus is on influencing the other person.  Not on what the person wants or doesn’t want.


A few salespeople want to sell without trying to get the other person to buy.  They would rather focus on people who want what they are selling, and skip all that persuading and convincing.


You can be successful using either method.


What really matters is how you want to sell.
