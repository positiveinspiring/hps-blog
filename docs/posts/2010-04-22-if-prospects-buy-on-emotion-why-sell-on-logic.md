It’s been well known for at least 70 years that “Prospects buy on emotion and justify with logic.”  So why is it that average salespeople rely only on logic to sell their products and services?


Perhaps they don’t realize that the very top producing salespeople always rely on their ability to reach the emotional core of their prospects.  The connections that they achieve result in profound relationships of mutual trust and respect.


This changes the basic concept of what selling really is.


You can read more about this concept in our book, “High Probability Selling”.  The first four chapters are [online](http://www.highprobsell.com/html/selling.html).
