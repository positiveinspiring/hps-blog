Here is another way of looking at the sales funnel metaphor and comparing the usual way of selling vs High Probability Selling. Rather than turning the funnel upside down, consider turning it inside out. 


Instead of being inside the funnel, the prospect is on the outside. Instead of being constrained, the prospect is free to move. 


The salesperson’s role is also different. In the usual way of selling, the salesperson pushes the sale. In our way, the salesperson points the way and lets the prospect choose.
