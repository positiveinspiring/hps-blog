Jacques Werth (founder of High Probability Selling), had this to say about giving away anything of value. 


*Always make sure that the recipient wants and will value what you give them, before you give it to them.* 


Don’t assume, ask. 


* **Want** – Do you want this?
* **Value** – If I give this to you, what will you do (with it)?

Many years ago, Jacques was meeting someone in his office, and the conversation soon turned to High Probability Selling.  The visitor saw the book, *High Probability Selling* and expressed some interest in it.


Jacques asked, “Do you want a copy of that book?” 


When the visitor said yes, Jacques asked, “If I give it to you, what will you do?” 


The visitor said, “I’ll read it,” so Jacques handed him a brand new copy, no charge.
