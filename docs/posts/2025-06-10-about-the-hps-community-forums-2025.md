Please see the most recent update on our [HPS Community Forum Series Webpage](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/hps-community-forum-series/). 


**What**.  We host a series of interactive meetings on Zoom where we talk about High Probability Selling (HPS).


**Purpose**.  To provide a community of like\-minded individuals, who would otherwise feel very isolated in a non\-HPS world.  We talk about HPS, but we do not try to teach how to do it in these meetings.


**Who**.  Anyone who has an interest in High Probability Selling is welcome.  No particular background is required.  No charge.  No registration required.  Just show up.


****When****.  We generally offer these forum meetings once per week on Thursdays.  Starting time is usually 9:30 AM or 1:30 PM (USA Eastern Time).  We are experimenting with different timing, to see what works best for our audience.


**Topics**.  We usually decide what to talk about a few days before each forum meeting.  We keep our options open.  We welcome suggestions from our audience.


**Recording**.  We record these Zoom meetings.  We email each recording link to the people who showed up at that meeting.  We will also email it to the people who request the recording ahead of time.
