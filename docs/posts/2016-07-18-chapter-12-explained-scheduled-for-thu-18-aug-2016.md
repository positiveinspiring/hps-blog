This teleseminar workshop is a review of the last chapter of the book, *High Probability Selling* by Jacques Werth and Nicholas Ruben.  Chapter 12 shows what “A Complete High Probability Sale” looks like, with all of the steps put together, but there are no explanations in that chapter about what is happening.  Each step is explained here.


The workshop is one session, one hour long (possibly longer), and led by Carl Ingalls.  It is live and interactive, with answers to participant’s questions.  Make sure you have a copy of the book with you, so you can follow the discussion.  An audio recording of the session will be sent to each participant.
