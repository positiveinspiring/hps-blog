The following is from a conversation I initiated 2025\-02\-28 on the [High Probability Selling Company page on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HighProbabilitySelling). 



> **HPS**:  One of the reasons I am so passionate about High Probability Selling is that it can make the world a more peaceful place.



> **Tom**:  Explain plz



> **HPS**:  Much of the unnecessary drama and conflict in this world comes from people trying to change other people against their will.  This is especially prevalent in sales.  Most salespeople have no idea that there is any other way of selling.  Paul Bunn and I are working to change that.



> **Tom**:  yes



> **Mike**:  HPS is direct to the question, honest in the relationship between buyer and seller, and unlike much activity called “the sales process” HPS excludes clever rhetorical and fake “getting to know you” posturing.
> 
> 
> Smoozing and begging and badgering is not part of HPS nor is assuming the sale through educating a person.
> 
> 
> In the end which begins with in the beginning, HPS is conditioned upon mutual respect.
> 
> 
> That’s why it has the potential to improve human relations.



> **Tom**:  I’ve read the book and used it when I was in sales…it does work…
> 
> 
> I always thought it needed a beginning to end video presentation of how it works…sorta like a role play….



> **Mike**:  that would be good.



> **Don**:  I was fortunate to have taken the class with Jacques, and that’s exactly what we did, role played through it all.  It was life changing.



> **HPS**:  Role playing does help, but it does not stand alone very well.  Before a student tries to say or do any of the things we teach, it is crucial that they understand what is behind it all.  We can do that in a class or coaching situation where the students are closely monitored, but we are concerned that the steps of HPS may do more harm than good when presented as a video recording that is viewed without that deeper understanding.  But we are working on it.
