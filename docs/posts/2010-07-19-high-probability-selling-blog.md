High Probability Selling is more about being than doing. It requires a radical change in a person, not just a radical change in action. 




*by Carl Ingalls and Jacques Werth*


High Probability Selling is more about being than doing.  It requires a radical change in a person, not just a radical change in action.


Who you are is revealed to other people by what you do.  People make conscious and unconscious decisions about who you really are, in response to things you do both consciously and unconsciously.  Very few people are fooled when you pretend to be someone you are not.  It feels wrong.


We teach High Probability Selling as a sales process, the details of what to do and how to do it.  Using this process will change who you are.  If it does not change you, it is not likely to work for you.


When you start using High Probability Selling, people will see a new person.  This is the kind of person that decision makers prefer to deal with.  People who cannot be or become that kind of person usually cannot “get themselves” to follow the process.  It feels wrong.


If you want to understand more about this, we recommend that you read the book “High Probability Selling” by Jacques Werth and Nicholas Ruben.  It tells the story of a person who is learning, doing, and being transformed by High Probability Selling.


Note:  You can read the Intro and the first 4 chapters of the book “High Probability Selling” [online](http://www.highprobsell.com/html/high_probability_selling_book.html).
