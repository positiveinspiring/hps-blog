High Probability Selling


A software salesperson related the following story about one of his recent sales appointments. 


“I went into a meeting with a prospect in his office, and our conversation started with him asking, ‘Tell me again what your software does.”   




As he spoke I noticed the prospect, whose elbows had been on the arms of his chair, was moving his hands down alongside the arms of his chair. So I moved my hands down alongside the arms of my chair. 


Our conversation continued, and then the prospect pulled his chair back from his desk and crossed his legs.  Then I crossed my legs in the same manner.   




A few minutes later, the prospect leaned back in his chair and put his hands behind his head, interlocking his fingers. 


About a minute later, I put my hands behind my head, mirroring his movements. The conversation was going well as I explained the benefits of our software system. 


A short time later, the prospect put his left hand back down on the arm of his chair and, with his right hand, reached around the back of his head grabbing his left ear.  


Then, I tried to emulate the prospect’s new movement and the prospect interrupted me, saying, “No, it’s the *right* hand holding the *left* ear… Are you new to NLP?” 


Savvy prospects like this one are becoming more and more prevalent.   They know a technique when they see one, even the “subtle” ones.  Selling to these prospects requires an entirely different way of thinking about sales, instead of learning another technique of persuasion.
