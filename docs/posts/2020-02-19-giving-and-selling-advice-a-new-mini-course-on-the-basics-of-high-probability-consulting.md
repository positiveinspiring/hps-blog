The next HPS Mini\-Course will be a short webinar session, on **Giving and Selling Advice** (an Intro to High Probability Consulting), on Thu 27 February 2020 at 10am USA Eastern Time.  39 minutes for $39


This mini\-course covers the basics on how to apply the ideas of High Probability Selling when giving or selling advice.  The focus is on the *delivery* of the advice, after any agreements of sale have already been made.


Whenever someone resists being persuaded to follow your advice, the methods of High Probability Consulting may work better.


The webinar will be led by Carl Ingalls in real\-time (live).  Content is mostly audio (speaking), with some video (text, graphics).  The session will be recorded (audio and video), and the recording will be made available to everyone who signs up (and pays for) the mini\-course.  The recording of this session may also be offered for sale later.


The webinar platform is GoToMeeting.  If you have not already downloaded and installed the GoToMeeting app on your computer or mobile phone, I strongly recommend that you do so at least 30 minutes before the webinar begins.  And even if you have the app and are already familiar with GoToMeeting, please note that they have changed their user interface quite significantly recently, so I recommend joining the meeting 5 or 10 minutes early.


The price is $39 USD per person.  However, I have 10 introductory discount coupons to give away, each $5 off.  If you want one, please contact me (Carl Ingalls) by phone at \+1 610\-627\-9030 or by email at [info@HighProbSell.com](mailto:info@HighProbSell.com) (before you click on the purchase link below).
