Have you ever noticed that the very top salespeople in the sales force rarely attend sales meetings? Have you ever wondered why?




*by Jacques Werth and Carl Ingalls*


Have you ever noticed that the very top salespeople in the sales force rarely attend the sales meetings that are mandatory for everyone else?   Have you ever wondered why?


The usual explanation is that their high sales performance causes them to be excused from having to attend the sales meetings.  But what if it’s the other way around?


What if their great success in selling is *because* they don’t attend the sales meetings?
