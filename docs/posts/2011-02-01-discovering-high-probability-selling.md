*by Jacques Werth* 


I did not create the sales process that I call High Probability Selling, I discovered it.  I discovered that the top 1% of sales producers do things very differently from the other 99%.  I also discovered that most of them cannot explain what they do, and are unable to teach it to others.


However, you can learn what they do and how to do it yourself by watching them and taking lots of notes.  That’s what I did, with hundreds of top producing salespeople in many different industries.


The result is High Probability Selling, a non\-persuasive sales process that is based upon studying what top salespeople actually do.  This process is illustrated in the book “High Probability Selling” and is taught in our sales training courses.
