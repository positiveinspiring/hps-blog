Wed 25 Mar:  **“A Complete High Probability Sale”** – Chapter 12 Explained
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This workshop is a review and interactive discussion of the last chapter of the book, [*High Probability Selling*](https://www.highprobsell.com/book-hps/index.html) by Jacques Werth and Nicholas Ruben.  That chapter shows what “A Complete High Probability Sale” looks like, but does not explain it.  Some people want a step\-by\-step explanation of what is happening there, with the opportunity to ask questions.  This workshop provides that.  We also discuss some of the details in the process that have been updated since the book was written. 


**Date and Time**: Friday 25 March 2022, from 11:00am to 1:00pm, USA Eastern Time. One session, about 2 hours long. 


Presented as an interactive video conference on Zoom, led by Carl Ingalls. 


**Price** is **$142 USD** per participant.
