The next HPS Mini\-Course will be a short webinar session, an **Intro to Prospecting with High Probability Selling**, on Fri 7 February 2020 at 1pm USA Eastern Time.  39 minutes for $39


This mini\-course covers the basic principles and guidelines of the High Probability Prospecting method.  How it differs from other selling methods and why.


Individual prospecting offers will not be reviewed in this mini\-course.  There are other options available for that.


The webinar will be led by Carl Ingalls in real\-time (live).  Content is mostly audio (speaking), with some video (text, graphics).  The session will be recorded (audio and video, plus transcript), and the recording will be made available to everyone who signs up (and pays for) the mini\-course.  The recording of this session may also be offered for sale later.


The webinar platform is GoToMeeting.  If you have not already downloaded and installed the GoToMeeting app on your computer or mobile phone, I strongly recommend that you do so at least 30 minutes before the webinar begins.  And even if you have the app and are already familiar with GoToMeeting, please note that they have changed their user interface quite significantly recently, so I recommend joining the meeting 5 or 10 minutes early.


The price is $39 USD per person.  However, I have 10 introductory discount coupons to give away, each $5 off.  If you want one, please contact me (Carl Ingalls) by phone at \+1 610\-627\-9030 or by email at [info@HighProbSell.com](mailto:info@HighProbSell.com) (before you click on the purchase link below).
