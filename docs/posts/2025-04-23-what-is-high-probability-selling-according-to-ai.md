High Probability Selling:  Overview
-----------------------------------


**High Probability Selling (HPS)** is a sales methodology focused on identifying and working only with prospects who are highly likely to buy, rather than trying to persuade or convince uninterested leads.  The method was developed after observing top sales performers across industries and documenting what made them consistently successful.


Key Principles
--------------


* **Early Qualification or Disqualification:**  Prospects are quickly assessed.  If they do not show genuine interest or intent to buy, the salesperson moves on without trying to convince them
* **No Persuasion or Pressure:**  HPS avoids traditional sales tactics like persuasion, objection handling, or closing tricks.  There’s no pushing, arguing, or chasing prospects
* **Focus on Features:**  Sales conversations center on the concrete features of the product or service, not on trying to sell benefits or create desire
* **Mutual Commitments:**  The process is based on mutual respect and clear agreements.  If a prospect’s conditions are met, they commit to buying
* **Efficient Use of Time:**  By not spending time on unlikely buyers, salespeople can focus on real opportunities, leading to higher closing rates and less frustration


Benefits
--------


* Reduces fear of rejection and call reluctance
* Avoids sales resistance and mistrust
* Simplifies the sales process and closing
* Leads to more authentic, direct, and respectful interactions


Summary Table
-------------




| Aspect | High Probability Selling (HPS) |
| --- | --- |
| Approach | Discovery, not persuasion |
| Prospect Handling | Early qualification/disqualification |
| Sales Tactics | No pressure, no convincing |
| Focus | Features, not benefits |

The above was created by Perplexity.ai, in response to my question, “What Is High Probability Selling.” You can read the original response [here](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-high-probability-selli-gja5CSlISOqIO7ZwCi8weA). 


I believe that the response from Perplexity is close enough to publish here. However, I would have worded some things slightly differently. For instance, “genuine interest” is not that much more valuable than ordinary interest.
