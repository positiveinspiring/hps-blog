Question (on Reddit)



> LinkedIn’s all sunshine, but how do you find actual pain points?  Beyond LinkedIn, where do you research?  How do you spot unspoken issues, and how do you dig deeper when they say “everything’s fine”?


Answer (by Paul Bunn)



> They’re saying everything is fine because they aren’t as naive as you assume.
> 
> 
> Successful prospects (humans) have a lot of experience with salespeople.  And they know a “Pain Point Digger” when they see one.
> 
> 
> They know if they reveal anything to a Pain Point Digger, the digger will use that information to TRY to manipulate them into doing something they don’t want to do now.
> 
> 
> They know from experience that Pain Point Diggers CANNOT be trusted.
> 
> 
> Digging for pain points is a logical tactic.  Human beings, including yourself, are illogical.
> 
> 
> It’s not your fault.  You’re just following logical orders.
