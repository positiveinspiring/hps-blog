The simplest way to sell something is to find people who want it. That’s the basic idea behind High Probability Selling (HPS). But why is it so hard to do? 


We complicate things. We go far beyond just *finding* people. We try to change their minds. We try to get them to do something we want them to do. 


These are deep habits, and they are very difficult to let go of. However, changing those habits is necessary to be successful when applying HPS. 


There must be some kind of emotional reward that reinforces our need to influence or persuade other people. Here is an article that talks about such rewards: “[How to Break Up with Your Bad Habits](https://hbr.org/2019/12/how-to-break-up-with-your-bad-habits)” by Jud Brewer.


We will discuss this in our next HPS Community Forum (scheduled for Thu 12 Oct 2023 at 10am USA Eastern Time on Zoom). If you want to attend, please [Contact Us](https://www.highprobsell.com/contact/) and please provide an email address where we can send you the Zoom sign\-on details. Anyone with an interest in High Probability Selling is welcome. No charge.
