***1\. Assume the Sale.***  Treat everyone who might buy from you as if they will.  Persuade and convince them.


People who are that easy to convince are probably unwilling or unable to buy.  Many more people will resent you making assumptions about what is theirs to decide.


***2\. Get Out There and Sell.***  You can’t sell ’em if you don’t meet ’em.


You will waste a lot of time that way, yours and theirs.  That will probably be the last time you get to meet them.


***3\. Act Like a Consultant.***  Present yourself as an expert and trusted advisor about what they need.


Most prospects know better than to believe that a salesperson can be an objective advisor.  Salespeople who pretend to be consultants are trusted even less.


***4\. Find Problems and Solve Them.***  Uncover the prospect’s needs and persuade them that you have the solutions.


Most prospects have more problems than they can ever get handled.  If it’s not a top priority for them when you call, they will not buy.


***5\. Overcome Objections and Close the Sale.***Convince prospects that their objections are wrong, or are actually benefits.


Objections are usually caused by the salesperson’s lack of authentic disclosure or by the prospect’s lack of a commitment to buy.
