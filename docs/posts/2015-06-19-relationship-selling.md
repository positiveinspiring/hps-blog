Would you trust someone who tried to form a relationship with you solely for the purpose of selling you something?


Many salespeople believe that the key to getting someone to buy is to build a “relationship” first.  They are the ones who say “how are you” on a cold call.


Saying “how are you” on a cold call is one of the signs that someone is going to try to get you to buy.  You may have noticed that, consciously or unconsciously, and it may affect your decision about whether you will buy from that salesperson or not.


In High Probability Selling, we don’t try to build relationships.  Relationships come from doing business, not the other way around.
