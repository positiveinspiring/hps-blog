We host a series of interactive meetings on Zoom where we talk about High Probability Selling.  


We are currently offering these meetings every week on Thursday, usually at 9:30 AM (USA Eastern Time).  See the [HPS Calendar](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/calendar/) for exact dates and times.  Meetings are 1 to 2 hours long (sometimes longer), including Q\&A. 


Some meetings will be **about** High Probability Selling, with very little instruction on how to do any of it.  These meetings are offered at **no charge**. 


Some meetings will focus on the **How To** of actually doing some aspect of HPS.  We are currently charging **$50 USD** per individual for these meetings ($25 USD for members of the HPS Forum). 


We will probably alternate between free and paid meetings, at least for now. 


We announce each meeting by email a few days before the meeting to current **members of the HPS Community Forum**.  If you want to be on that mailing list, please [Contact Us](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/contact/).  Sometimes, we also announce the meeting on this blog, but not always.


For the free meetings, anyone who has an interest in High Probability Selling is welcome.  No particular background is required.  No charge.  No registration required.  Just show up.  For these free meetings, click on [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83436793215?pwd=amFiMVorZDFWbmxpdnJCOUphVThlUT09) at the appointed time (see above).  Meeting ID \= 834 3679 3215\.  Passcode \= 751935


The paid meetings will be offered on the HPS website as a product in the [HPS Store](https://highprobsell.com/store/) for $50 USD ($25 for forum members).  If you purchase a meeting before it begins, you will receive instructions for joining us on Zoom.  You will also get the recording and chat.  If you purchase a meeting later or do not attend, you will get the recording and chat, same price.


**Recording**s.  We record these Zoom meetings.  We email each video recording link (plus the chat) to the people who showed up at that meeting.  Recordings (with chat) for some of the past meetings are available for purchase in the list below (click on the price). 


No bots are allowed.  This includes AI note takers and recorders.  Humans only.
