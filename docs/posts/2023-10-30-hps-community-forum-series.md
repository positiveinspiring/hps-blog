**What.** We host a series of live and interactive meetings on Zoom where we talk about High Probability Selling.  


**Who.** Anyone who has an interest in High Probability Selling is welcome.  No particular background is required.  Humans only, no bots. 


**Cost**. The Community Forum series is supported by voluntary **donations**. Individuals who sign up for a meeting can choose the amount they contribute, even if it is zero. 


**Schedule.** We offer these meetings every week on Thursday at 9:30 AM (USA Eastern Time).  When Thursday falls on or too close to a holiday, we either skip that week, or choose a different day. See the [HPS Calendar](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/calendar/) for exact dates and times.  Meetings are 1 to 3 hours long, including Q\&A.


**Email.** We announce each meeting by email a few days before the meeting to current **members of the HPS Community Forum**.  If you want to be on that mailing list, please [Contact Us](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/contact/).  We also announce the meeting on this blog, and we may mention it on some social media platforms.


**Register**. If you want to see a list of (or sign up for) an upcoming meeting, you may visit [Upcoming Forum Meetings](https://highprobsell.com/product-category/forum-live/).
