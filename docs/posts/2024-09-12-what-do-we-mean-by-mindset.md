We asked ChatGPT for its opinion on what is mindset, and here is what it gave us. 



> A mindset refers to a mental attitude or inclination, a particular way of thinking or approaching situations. It encompasses beliefs, assumptions, and attitudes that shape how individuals perceive and respond to the world around them. Mindsets can influence behavior, decision\-making, and overall outlook on life, often determining one’s approach to challenges, opportunities, and relationships.


Not bad, in my opinion.


And here is something I (Carl Ingalls) put together on the topic a while ago, but haven’t published until now.


Mindset drives our thinking, actions, and reactions.  It affects how other people interact with us, whether consciously or unconsciously.  Furthermore, our mindset affects our ability to learn and apply High Probability Selling (HPS). 


Here are some of the elements of the HPS Mindset. 


* **Principles and guidelines** are conscious ideas of what to do and what not to do in specific situations. For example, if a prospect tells us that they do not want what we are offering, then we move on to the next prospect in our list, without trying to change anyone’s mind.
* **Concepts and beliefs** are mostly conscious ideas of what we believe are true. For example, “Sales resistance is created by the salesperson when they try to *get* someone to buy.” Another example, “It is quicker and more effective to find someone who wants what you are selling, than to try to convince anyone who doesn’t.”
* **Attitudes and worldview and some beliefs** are things that we don’t think about as much, but which can have a huge effect on our interactions with others. An attitude of acceptance and respect is more likely to lead to a good business relationship than a controlling attitude.
* **Language** matters, because the words we choose affect our thinking and therefore our behavior, and sometimes in subtle (but important) ways. For instance, words like win, drive, steer, funnel, and pipeline can encourage a competitive or even manipulative attitude. Even thinking those words can have subtle effects.
* **Habits** may be the most difficult to change, and especially the ones we don’t think about. For instance, many of us are habitual talkers, and that gets in the way of listening, which is so very important in HPS. Another habit is trying to help people who do not want our help.
