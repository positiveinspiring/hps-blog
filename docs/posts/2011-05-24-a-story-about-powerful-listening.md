“I’ve been in sales for over twenty years, and I’ve made a decent living. But now we have a son who’s a freshman in college and a daughter who’s sixteen. Tuition for both of them, even with student loans, might break us. Frankly, I need to make more money. What can you do for me?” 




*by Jacques Werth*


I got a call from someone named Ed.  “I’m interested in your sales training programs,” he said.


“What does it mean when you say you’re interested,” I asked.


“What would happen if I took your sales training courses?”


I said, “I don’t know.  Why do you ask?”


He said, “I’ve been in sales for over twenty years, and I’ve made a decent living.  But now we have a son who’s a freshman in college and a daughter who’s sixteen.  Tuition for both of them, even with student loans, might break us.  Frankly, I need to make more money.  What can you do for me?”


“What do you mean?” I asked.


“I have been reading up on all kinds of sales training and yours seems to be the only one that is entirely different from the way I’ve been selling all along.”


“Why is selling differently important?” I asked.


“It’s like the difference between a tricycle and a Harley.  I need something with a lot more power.  And, your book describes a way of selling that has a lot more power.”


“Isn’t it a lot more difficult to learn to ride a Harley than a tricycle?” I said.


Ed said, “I’m willing to do whatever it takes.”


“I suggest that you fill out two questionnaires that will give us an estimate of how likely it is that you will be successful with High Probability Selling.  If they indicate that you are a good candidate for High Probability Selling, then you might want to take the starter course called ‘Powerful Listening.’  Does that work for you?”


“What does that cost?”


“There’s no charge for the questionnaires,” I said.  “The cost of the Powerful Listening Workshop is $165\.”


“I’m in a hurry to get started, said Ed.  “Is there any reason you don’t want me to just sign up for the training immediately?  I’m at your website and I know what the costs are.”


“We would rather be confident that High Probability Selling is a good fit for you before you enroll,” I said.  “That would be better for us.  How would it be for you?”


“How long before I’ll get results from those questionnaires?” Ed asked.


“Between three and four working days is normal.  What do you want to do?”


Ed said, “If you tell me how to find your questionnaires I’ll answer the questions immediately.  And, thank you for being so helpful.”


I said, “You’re welcome.”


He said, “This whole conversation has been just like what’s in your book.  I can’t wait to learn how to do that.  Thanks again.”


I said, “You’re welcome, again.  Good bye.”
