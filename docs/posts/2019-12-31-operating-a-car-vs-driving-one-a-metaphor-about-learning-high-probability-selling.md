I learned how to drive on a tractor.  No, I take that back.  I learned how to *operate* a tractor on a farm, and from that, I learned how to *operate* a car.  That’s not the same as learning how to *drive* a car on roads that include other cars.


We lived at the end of a very long and narrow gravel driveway, and therefore the cars driving on the paved road at the other end of the driveway were not really visible.  Imagine if I had never seen anyone driving a car on a real road (nor ridden in one).  And further imagine that I believed that I knew how to drive, and was confident enough to take a car on the road.


To me, this scenario seems a bit like learning the how\-to part of High Probability Selling (HPS), without learning the mindset of it.  The process without the understanding.


Jacques Werth preferred to teach HPS as a step\-by\-step process, a recipe or script.  He was very successful with a number of people.  For those people, understanding came after the doing.


However, focusing on the process as a recipe or script does not work at all for a lot of other people.  For some of them, it can create misconceptions about HPS.  Without the underlying understanding, many of them seem to have difficulties in remembering the details of the process correctly.


I prefer to focus more on the mindset of HPS and less on the process, both in my teachings of it and in my application.

I plan to offer a very short mini\-course on the Mindset of HPS as a 39\-minute webinar, sometime in January 2020\.  It will appear on the [HPS Google Calendar](https://www.highprobsell.com/workshops/index.html#calendar), and also as an announcement in this blog.


I also offer a 3\-week workshop on the [Mindset of HPS](https://www.highprobsell.com/workshops/mindset/), which goes much deeper into the material.  Scheduling is based on demand.


Comments and questions are welcomed.
