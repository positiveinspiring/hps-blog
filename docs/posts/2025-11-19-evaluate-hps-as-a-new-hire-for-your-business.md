In this session, we explore how to evaluate High Probability Selling as you would evaluate a new hire for your business — calmly, objectively, and on your own terms.




 

I’d like to invite you to a session where we’ll take an objective look at whether **High Probability Selling (HPS)** is the right fit for your business.  Instead of simply asking whether HPS will work for you, for which the stock answer has traditionally been “yes”, we will show you a new way to conduct this evaluation for yourself, as a business owner (even if you don’t see yourself this way, we invite you to try on that identity for this exercise). 


We will be changing your perspective from “will HPS fit what I am doing now?” and treating the question as if you’re “**hiring** HPS as an **employee”**.


When you hire someone for your team or business, you’re not just buying a service; you’re evaluating their **skills**, their **fit** with your culture, and how they’ll contribute to the long\-term goals of your business.  In the same way, HPS can be considered a **new hire** for your business — one that could guide the transformation of your sales process and approach.


In this meeting, we’ll explore:


1. **What it means to “hire” HPS**  
Instead of simply purchasing a sales methodology or a training program, what would it look like to **employ HPS as an expert** within your business?  We’ll discuss how to evaluate whether it’s a **good fit** as you would with any prospective team member: Does it have the **expertise**?  Does it align with your **values**?  Can it help your business grow in the direction you want?
2. **Shifting from “tool or thing I have to learn” to “team member”**  
In this context, HPS isn’t just something you “use.”  You’re hiring an expert to integrate into your business.  This shift in perspective requires thinking beyond the individual actions and behaviors you might need to adopt and focusing on the broader, organizational impact HPS can bring.  **How would you onboard and integrate HPS into your processes**?  What type of culture and systems would need to be in place to successfully employ this new “team member”?
3. **Evaluating HPS from a hiring perspective**  
We’ll discuss the **criteria** you would use to evaluate any new hire:
	* **Skills and Expertise**: What does HPS bring to the table, and how does it match your business needs?
	* **Compatibility**: Will HPS integrate smoothly with your existing sales processes, mindset, and culture?
	* **Long\-Term Impact**: What are the expected outcomes if you decide to hire HPS?  What does success look like, and how do you measure it?
4. **Addressing potential barriers to hiring HPS**  
Just like hiring a new employee, the process may require **shifts** in how you think about sales, systems, and organizational culture.  What are the **challenges** to hiring HPS?  How might existing systems, mindsets, or business philosophies create friction during the integration process?
5. **How to approach HPS as a “new hire”**  
Once you’ve decided whether HPS is a good fit, we’ll discuss **how to onboard it** into your business and begin the implementation process.  What’s involved in bringing this “new employee” on board, and how do you align HPS with your **current sales team, CRM systems, and processes**?


The goal of this session is to provide a **framework for hiring** HPS as an expert to guide the **transformation** of your sales process, rather than simply adding another tool to your existing system.  We’ll help you evaluate if this “new hire” is the right fit for your needs, culture, and goals.


If you’re interested in this perspective and would like to discuss how to decide whether HPS is the right “employee” for your business, you are welcome to join us on this week’s HPS Community Forum.
