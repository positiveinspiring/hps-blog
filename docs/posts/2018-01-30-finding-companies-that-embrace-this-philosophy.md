*Finding Companies that embrace this philosophy*  

Hello.  I ran across your site today after getting pitched yet another sales training program.   I have been in sales and business development for close to 30 years.   May companies are so stooped into the old school ways of selling it is ridiculous.   I embrace this philosophy but how do I connect with companies that want people trained using this thought process?  Do you have roles available within your consulting practice?


I’ve decided to provide an answer here on this blog.


The short answer is – ask them.  Use High Probability Prospecting to find a job, and use High Probability Disqualifying to filter out the ones that aren’t going to work for you.


The best detailed instructions I have seen for doing this are in a blog post written by Jacques Werth in 2009:  [Finding the Sales Position You Want](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/2009/08/05/finding-the-sales-position-you-want/).


However, there are two changes we would recommend today.  The first is to make your prospecting offer much shorter, 30 words or less, even if you have to include only one feature instead of two (see [Guidelines for Creating a High Probability Prospecting Offer](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/2014/09/04/guidelines-for-creating-a-high-probability-prospecting-offer/)).  The second change is that we now recommend leaving voice mail messages (see [this article](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/2017/07/28/people-use-the-phone-differently-today-voicemail/)).


Before accepting a sales position, find out if you will be allowed to sell the way you choose to sell, or not.  Ask about that directly.  If part of your compensation is a salary, that may mean that they are paying you to sell the way they tell you to sell.


Another article that might help is:  [Finding the Job You Want – Josh’s Story](https://highprobabilityselling.blog/2009/10/09/finding-the-job-you-want-joshs-story/)


Happy Prospecting.
