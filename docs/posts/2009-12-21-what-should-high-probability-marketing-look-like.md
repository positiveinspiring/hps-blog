What kind of marketing would fit with High Probability Selling? A lot of marketing methods are designed to persuade people to buy a product or service, and they often present a very unbalanced picture of the strengths and weaknesses of what they are pushing. This is contrary to the way we train people to sell.

What kind of marketing would fit with High Probability Selling?  A lot of marketing methods are designed to persuade people to buy a product or service, and they often present a very unbalanced picture of the strengths and weaknesses of what they are pushing.  This is contrary to the way we train people to sell.


Selling and marketing are different.  However, if persuasion and telling less than the whole truth don’t work in selling as well as many people believe, then how well do they really work in marketing?


This is not a rhetorical question.  We struggle with this every day, and we really would like to know what our readers think.  Many of you have a lot of experience using our selling process, and have a deep understanding of what it means.


We do have a few ideas for marketing HPS, and we will discuss them in upcoming blog posts.  Meanwhile, we would love to hear your thoughts.
