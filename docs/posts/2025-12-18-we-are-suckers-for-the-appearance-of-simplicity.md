Modern systems promise simplicity everywhere we look.  
Fewer buttons.  Fewer choices.  Smarter defaults.  
“Don’t worry — we know what you want.”


And we fall for it.


But what’s often called *simple* isn’t simpler.  
It’s just **less visible**.


Instead of asking, systems decide.  
Things happen that we didn’t choose.  
Nothing feels complicated — until something goes wrong.


Then the work returns to us and becomes our problem:  
figuring out what happened  
and how to stop it from happening again.


The complexity never disappeared.  
It just moved out of sight.


We accept this because we’re busy.  Overloaded.  
Anything that promises to “just work” feels like relief.


But there’s a cost.


When understanding is removed along with effort,  
control fades.  
predictability fades.  
trust fades.


Real simplicity doesn’t hide decisions.  
It makes them clear.


Once you see the difference,  
you see it everywhere.
