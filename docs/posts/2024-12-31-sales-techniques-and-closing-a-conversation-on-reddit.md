The [following conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/salestechniques/comments/1hozp2d/being_okay_with_it_all_how_to/) is copied from the subReddit called “Sales Techniques”.


Here is the opening question:



> I sell a pretty high ticket item at $7000 over zoom meetings. My average is to close 5\-6 new clients per week. BUT, I miss on another 10 or so. Yes that is a great close ratio and my employer is incredibly happy with that. But I cannot seem to shake off the ones I miss.. anyone else? Oh, 2025 will be my 35th year in sales, you would think I was over this by now..


Here is how I (Paul Bunn, aka [Illustrious\_Bunnster](https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious_Bunnster/)) replied:



> There is a way to reduce the number of appointments with the prospects who aren’t likely to buy in the first place.

> By this point, you probably intuitively know at least half of the low probability prospects that don’t really qualify for an appointment yet.

> Use the criteria for those that buy to (temporarily) disqualify the ones who don’t really fit, that you might hope will buy but don’t.

> When you become more selective about whom you meet with, your number of sales will actually increase overall AND compared to the number of appointments you book.

> It will initially feel like you’re going to “lose” sales, but you can’t lose sales that aren’t going to follow through anyway.
>

> The time and energy you save from meeting with low probability prospects will lead to more “found” sales who are looking for a salesperson with higher standards.
