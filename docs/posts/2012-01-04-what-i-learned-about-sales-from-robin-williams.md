On an evening in 1980, I was standing at the bar talking with Jo Anne Astrow, one of the owners of the Improv Comedy Club in West Hollywood. As usual, the club was packed with a large spirited crowd, including several well\-known entertainers. Robin Williams came up and said “Hey, Jo” and gave her a hug. Jo Anne said, “Meet my cousin Jacques.”

On an evening in 1980, I was standing at the bar talking with Jo Anne Astrow, one of the owners of the Improv Comedy Club in West Hollywood.  As usual, the club was packed with a large spirited crowd, including several well\-known entertainers.


Robin Williams came up and said “Hey, Jo” and gave her a hug.  His frenetic energy was like a burst of static electricity.


Jo Anne said, “Meet my cousin Jacques. He’s visiting from Philly.”


I said, “What are you up to Robin?”


“Trying to perfect a new routine – something that connects better and gets more laughs.”


I said, “You seem to be getting the hang of it lately.”


Robin said, “If I can’t do that I might have to wash dishes.  What do you do?”


“I’m in sales.”


“How are you doing?” he asked.


“I’m the sales manager of a company that just became the industry leader.”


Robin said, “Then we’re both up to the same thing – unless you wanted a career in dish washing.”


Yes, we are both up to the same thing.  In a way, all of us are in sales.  We each have to get very good at selling in order to be successful in doing whatever it is that we want to do.  Otherwise, we might as well be washing dishes.
