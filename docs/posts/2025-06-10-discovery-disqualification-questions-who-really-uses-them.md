For those of you who have been HPS practitioners for a long time as well as those who have just begun to discover HPS, Discovery Disqualification questions are a key component of the HPS process, typically done during the sales appointment.


As many know and the book discusses, these 12 or 13 questions are designed to discover, inquire about, and negotiate or disqualify the typical deal breakers in a sale. In traditional selling these issues often come up towards the end of the sales appointment, and require a myriad of memorized objection handling and closing tactics in order to chase this herd of deal\-breaker cats and get the sale.


In HPS, we ask these questions as soon as possible in the process. Most people who are introduced to that idea find it a groundbreaking concept. And a real relief.


These questions are a great idea, until we go back to the real world, and scare ourselves out of asking them.


We agree they should be used. Most of us understand where the idea of asking them came from. But when  the real world is engaged, most HPSers bail out before they ask question 3 at best.


All the questions make perfect sense until we start hoping we don’t have to be that direct.


After all, being that direct might offend someone. Being that direct might make people (us) uncomfortable. And why the heck am I asking these questions anyway? Just cuz some guy named Jacques said so? What could he possibly know about my business? My prospects? My clients? I’m sure they worked great for him, but I’m different. 


It turns out that the reason we don’t use them, and the reason some of the more successful practitioners do use them, Is Not What It Seems.


It’s not a thick skin. It’s not being extroverted or introverted. It’s not being detached from the outcome. And it’s certainly not courage. And it’s not training. And it’s not fear by itself.


And “Just Do It” won’t work sustainably enough.


It’s something else. And that something else is a key component to what makes HPS as powerful and distinctive when compared to any other sales process.


And on this forum call we will share that key component, with which all things HPS are based and upon which all successful HPS practitioners found their feet and foundation.
