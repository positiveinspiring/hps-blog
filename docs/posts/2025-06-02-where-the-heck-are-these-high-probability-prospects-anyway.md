A Review of the Neil Myers’ Recording on High Probability Prospects, led by Paul Bunn (recording [available here](https://high-probability-selling.myshopify.com/cart/42589175447612:1?channel=buy_button), $50 USD)


This week’s HPS Community Forum will be a live discussion on a previously recorded HPS workshop segment that delivers a mutual understanding of the HPS paradigm shift as it applies to your prospects, markets, and sales experience. 


For those of you who are relatively new to HPS, a High Probability Prospect is defined as follows:  Someone who needs, wants, and is willing and able to buy from you now, if you can meet the prospect’s conditions of satisfaction.


The challenge of course is, in a world in which salespeople are expected to make people into sales, by the force and irresistible rhetoric of the salesperson’s skills, how could these High Probability Prospects (HPPs) even exist?  Why haven’t I seen them before?  You have seen them, and you probably have been one, but never realized it.


One of the first steps in being able to “see” these HPPs is to realize they not only exist, but they have been right under our collective noses for decades.  Like other perspective shift experiences, realizing the presence of these HPPs is like viewing auto\-stereograms, also known as Magic Eye 3D, (see [Hidden Illusions That’ll Make Your Brain Hurt](https://www.buzzfeed.com/agh/tk-hidden-illusions-thatll-make-your-brain-hurt) on BuzzFeed).


Once you’ve seen the hidden image, seeing it again gets easier and easier through practice. This HPS Forum session is intended to provide a similar “aha” level of awareness of the paradigm shift, which will provide a foundation for understanding and implementing HPS with minimal stress and effort.


By the end of this session, you should be able to answer the following FAQs:  
Do HPPs really exist?  
What creates HPPs?  
Who creates HPPs?  
What exactly are they?  
How have I missed seeing them before?  
Can HPPs be created by me?  
Are there enough of them out there?
