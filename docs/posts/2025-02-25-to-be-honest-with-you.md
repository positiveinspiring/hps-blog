The following was my response on Reddit to someone who suggested a salesperson say, “to be honest with you…”


Basically, be honest.  Saying you’re honest, even as a space filler, creates doubt and distrust.  Same thing with having the intention of getting prospects to trust you.  That’s inherently manipulative.  Just be trustworthy and trust the prospect first.


Radical honesty is more profitable.


Our prospects have so many choices nowadays, and they are the source of our prosperity.  “Disrespect the source of your prosperity, and it will continually elude you.”  C. Ingalls


A reply to my post on Reddit was as follows: “Never thought about it that way!”
