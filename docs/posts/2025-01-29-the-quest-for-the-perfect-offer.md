In spite of advising myself and others, for like 30 years, to give up the search for the perfect offer to which everyone will say “yes”, I confess that I still get excited by a compelling and crafty series of words that appear from time to time.


As it turns out, even marketing greats like Seth Godin can believe strongly in an irresistible offer which he was convinced would work perfectly. He’s written more than 20 super successful books about marketing. If anyone can create a perfect offer, he can.


The following is a timeless (IMHO) blog post about an irresistible offer (almost a no\-brainer) that he created and used in real life, with real people, and the outcomes he observed.

Worth a careful read…or three. I get something more everytime I read it. Seth’s blog has always been for me, time well spent.
