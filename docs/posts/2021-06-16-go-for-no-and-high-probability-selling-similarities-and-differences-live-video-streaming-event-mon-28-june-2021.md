Andrea Waltz and Carl Ingalls will explore the similarities and differences between these two selling systems via a (mostly) unscripted conversation.  The conversation will be streamed live to the High Probability Selling company page on Facebook, at <https://www.facebook.com/HighProbabilitySelling/>.  If you choose to “like” that page, Facebook will automatically notify you of this event.


The event is open to the public and is free (no charge).  No registration required. 


Date:  Monday 28 June 2021  
Time:  1pm USA Eastern Time (same as New York City)  
Duration:  1 hour, approx.


Comments posted to the streaming event on Facebook will be forwarded to both presenters, and we will answer questions if we can. 


The event will be recorded, and the recording will be posted to the High Probability Selling channel on YouTube ([www.youtube.com/channel/UC3jsAgiQj4qg1XqA9T\_mOpw](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3jsAgiQj4qg1XqA9T_mOpw)).  If you subscribe to that channel, YouTube will notify you when the recording is available.


It may be useful to read the book, *Go for No!*, by Richard Fenton and Andrea Waltz, before the discussion.
