Why is it that most people who attend sales training courses and seminars show very little sustained improvement? Why doesn’t modern sales training consistently produce successful salespeople?
Why is it that most sales training courses and seminars contain large doses of motivational psychology?  Why is it that the sales profession is the largest user of motivational training?  Is it coincidental that the next largest user is the armed forces?  What is it that the armed forces and salespeople have in common that requires them to be the largest users of motivational training?


How many carpenters, mechanics, CPAs, claims adjusters or veterinarians need to attend motivational seminars in order to do their jobs?


How many professions come with a built\-in fear of rejection and a reluctance to do the job? Why do approximately eighty percent of the people who enter the selling profession leave within the first few years? Why do so many who remain feel trapped or burned out in their jobs?


Why do most people try to avoid salespeople?


Is this all endemic to selling or is there something fundamentally wrong with the way we sell that causes these problems? Could it be that "Selling as the Art of Persuasion" is a concept whose time has come and gone? Could it be that it’s no longer profitable to persuade and convince prospects to buy what they don’t already want?


We maintain that persuading and convincing is no longer a viable selling strategy. Even worse, the attempt to do so causes too much tension, stress, and frustration.  Therefore, we re\-invented the selling process.


Everything’s changed. All the rules are different.  Fear of rejection is no longer an issue. Resistance disappears. Relationships of mutual trust and respect develop naturally.


Self\-esteem is a natural result of the process. Salespeople have standards. "Who they are as people" and "who they are when they’re selling" no longer have to be different.


High Probability Selling trains salespeople how to discover whether there is a mutually acceptable basis for doing business – without using manipulative techniques.  High Probability Selling is not an improvement on, or a variation of, any sales technique you know. It’s a new paradigm that requires salespeople to sell with integrity in order to achieve outstanding results.


High Probability Selling takes salespeople off their knees and puts them back on their feet, with dignity, where they belong.
