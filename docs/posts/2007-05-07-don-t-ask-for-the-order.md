High Probability® Selling   




This may seem confusing, since traditionally the whole idea of selling is to get an order from a customer. But if the order is a natural outcome of the conversation between prospect and seller—that is, if there is a mutually acceptable reason for doing business from the start—then your primary concern should be to draw up the prospect’s Conditions of Satisfaction, for price, delivery, features, etc.  After each item ask, “Is that what you want?” Then, each item becomes a “close.”  This automatically creates a series of two\-way commitments and the order is the natural end result.
