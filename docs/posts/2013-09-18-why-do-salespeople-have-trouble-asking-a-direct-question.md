Gary Boye, a top sales trainer from Buffalo, NY once told me, “I teach salespeople to ask their prospects, ‘Do you like the carpet?’ or ‘Do you like the flooring?’  Only about 10% will ask that question.  Have you encountered that problem?”


I said, “Yes, I have.  We teach salespeople to ask, ‘Is this something you want?’  It’s a simple and direct question, but almost half have trouble asking it.  I don’t know why.”
