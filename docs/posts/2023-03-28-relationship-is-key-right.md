Ok, we can all agree on that one. 


However, we might not all agree on the why, when, and how regarding building a relationship. 


Here are some of my thoughts. 


**Why.** If our purpose for creating a relationship is to get the prospect to buy from us, then we end up with a synthetic relationship. Too many prospects will see it as fake, which limits trust. 


**When.** Same problem if we push for a relationship too early, while we are still strangers. Start with business, and let the relationship unfold over time. Donâ€™t be in a rush. 


**How.** Let the relationship be built on listening and acceptance, not talking and pushing. 


We would all love to hear your thoughts and experiences regarding relationships and selling. Please put your thoughts in comments on this blog post.
