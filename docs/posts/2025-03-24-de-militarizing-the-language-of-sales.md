We tend to speak in the language that we think.  The reverse is also true.  Yet, outside of scripting, we tend to pay very little attention to our words spoken and thought.


Words thought and spoken, before, during and after a sales interaction will affect your mindset, which will affect mutual trust and respect.  Whether these words, and their associated behaviors and perceptions increase or decrease trust and respect is up to you and your awareness.


**War and Military Terms Used in Sales and Marketing**  
Killing it  
Crushing it  
Nailed it  
Target marketing  
Targeted businesses  
Closing (with the enemy; in\-range)  
Tactics  
Strategy  
Campaign  
Sales Force  
Captive (agent)  
Capture (Lead information)  
Resources  
Guerilla Marketing – asymmetrical warfare  
Overcome  
Lay\-down sale (implies surrender and submission)  
Hunter (type of salesperson)  
A hunter eats what they kill (quote from a hunter)  
Winning sales  
Losing sales


These terms create an adversarial relationship with the prospect.  They also dehumanize the other person, which may help to justify mistreatment and violence.


You often hear warlike language in sales and business culture today.  You might even use some of it yourself.


If you want to change that:  
Step One:  Acknowledge your current state  
Step Two:  Understand your WHY for your current state  
Step Three:  Understand your WHY for your desired state  
Step Four:  Test and implement new words
