Announcing a series of **Mini\-Courses in High Probability Selling**.  These are short topics, each delivered in a single webinar session.  39 minutes  $39


The webinar platform is GoToMeeting, led by Carl Ingalls in real\-time (live).  Content is mostly audio (speaking), with some video (text, graphics).


The first HPS Mini\-Course will be about the *Conditional Commitment Question*, scheduled for Tuesday 19 November 2019 at 1:00pm USA Eastern Time (same time zone as New York).  This first session is limited to a total of 10 participants.


The price is $39 USD per person.  However, I have 10 introductory discount coupons to give away, each $20 off.  If you want one, please contact me (Carl Ingalls) by phone at \+1 610\-627\-9030 or by email at [info@HighProbSell.com](mailto:info@HighProbSell.com)
