High Probability Selling


During lunch today, I went to my optometrist in an attempt to get my classes repaired.  It was a minor repair.  I could have done the work once I purchased the parts.  The only problem was that my optometrist’s business is set up to facilitate the purchase of new glasses.  


Customers that want repairs or parts, no matter how minor, are directed to the department that sells frames and lenses.  I waited for about 30 minutes, anxiously waiting for someone to assist me.  Nothing happened.    




I don’t necessarily blame the salespeople.  After all, why handle a minor repair job when a much more immediately lucrative set of glasses might be sold?  And they were just following the owners’ business model.  And I clearly didn’t fit their model. 


And that model has a flaw.  The awareness of what customers, in my case existing long\-term customers, want…other than selling a new pair of glasses to us every year or so…was somehow overlooked.


Once I realized that, unless I was willing to wait another hour or two, my repair was not going to happen at that establishment I went to a nearby mall and had Pearle Vision do it in less than 5 minutes.  I walked in, said what I wanted, they fixed the glasses, at no charge.  Easy.  Quick.  Apparently a good fit to *their* business model.


While at the Pearle location, I noticed something else.  Their counter displays stated the key features of their services – instead of the latest cool frames to buy – the one I noticed most was a 60\-day complete satisfaction guarantee.  From personal experience, my existing optometrist doesn’t have that either.


My next glasses purchase will likely be from Pearle.  I wonder if my (old) optometrist, a long established neighborhood\-type place that I purchased from every year for 10 years or so, is aware of that.   


Events like this one get me thinking about how well we do at being aware of what our customers want, versus what we want to sell.


Do you know what your existing customers want?  


Does your business model make it easy for both of you to find out?  And deliver?


Have you tested it lately?
