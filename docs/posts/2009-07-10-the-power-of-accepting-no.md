The following is part of a recent conversation on Twitter.com between Carl Ingalls (<http://twitter.com/Carl_Ingalls>) and Christina Luminea (<http://twitter.com/cristinaluminea>).  Jacques Werth (<http://twitter.com/JacquesWerth>) is the owner of this blog.


[Carl](http://twitter.com/Carl_Ingalls/statuses/2556116551):  Your ability to take “no” for an answer makes it easier for others to say “yes”.

[Christina](http://twitter.com/cristinaluminea/statuses/2560103362):  This really got me thinking: RT ([@Carl\_Ingalls](http://twitter.com/Carl_Ingalls): Your ability to take “no” for an answer makes it easier for others to say “yes”. Thanks Carl


[Carl](http://twitter.com/Carl_Ingalls/statuses/2560274895):  Thank you for the RT, and I would love to hear about your thinking. I’m always looking for better ideas \& ways to say them.


[Christina](http://twitter.com/cristinaluminea/statuses/2560633307):  I think you are right. By taking “no” for an answer you show people respect for their ideas and beliefs. You build trust.


[Christina](http://twitter.com/cristinaluminea/statuses/2560692501):  People will be more confident to say ‘yes’ next time, knowing their opinion counts and they are not taken for granted.


[Christina](http://twitter.com/cristinaluminea/statuses/2560727537):  The strangest thing is all of this makes sense but I wouldn’t have thought of it before. This is why: Thank you!


[Carl](http://twitter.com/Carl_Ingalls/statuses/2561084799):  Thank you very much for sharing your thinking with me, and expressing it so well. It helps clarify my own thinking.


[Carl](http://twitter.com/Carl_Ingalls/statuses/2561112076):  The idea of “taking no for an answer” is part of a sales philosophy I’ve been studying, called High Probability Selling.


[Carl](http://twitter.com/Carl_Ingalls/statuses/2561146980):  I am helping the founder with a blog. May I have your permission to quote your tweets there? [http://TinyURL.com/HPSBlog](http://tinyurl.com/HPSBlog)


[Christina](http://twitter.com/cristinaluminea/statuses/2565764642):  Please feel free to use any of my tweets and I am looking forward to share thoughts and ideas with you, in the future.


[Jacques](http://twitter.com/JacquesWerth/statuses/2571323657):  Your conversation with [@cristinaluminea](http://twitter.com/cristinaluminea) would be good to post on our blog.
