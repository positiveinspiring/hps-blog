**Customers** are often looking for a product or service in the moment. They may or may not buy again, and the interaction tends to be about *the transaction itself*. Traditional selling methods often chase customers, using persuasion to turn a “no” or a “maybe” into a “yes” right now, with little consideration for longer term business. 


**Clients**, on the other hand, are people who want what you are offering, are prepared to buy, and willingly agree to mutual commitments. The relationship that naturally forms is based on honesty, respect, and trust. In HPS, clients close themselves because they see the value for *their* reasons and in *their* own time, and not because you pushed them. 


The **High Probability Selling** method naturally attracts clients more than customers. It is more likely to lead to long\-term relationships with people who actually want what you’re offering, instead of trying to convince reluctant buyers.
