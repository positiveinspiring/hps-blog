This is a recording of an interactive teleseminar presented by Jacques Werth sometime between 2006 and 2009\.  He explains the basics of using High Probability Prospecting by telephone.


The price is $43 USD.  Delivered as an MP3 digital download.  32\.4 MB, 71 minutes.


You can [listen to a sample here](https://www.highprobsell.com/products/Warm_Calling_Sampler.mp3).


You can [purchase this recording here](https://www.highprobsell.com/products/index.html#JWerth) (and then click on the button for *Turning Cold Calling into Warm Calling*).


This is Jacques Werth at his best.  He presents some very good arguments about why salespeople should follow High Probability Selling when prospecting.  A good stab at answering his own question, “How can I convince you that convincing doesn’t work?”


However, this is High Probability Prospecting as it was taught 10 years ago.  The basic principles remain the same, but some important details in the steps of the process have changed since then.
