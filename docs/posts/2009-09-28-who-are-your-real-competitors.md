Who are the people that are taking sales away from you?  What is it that they are doing better than you are?





*by Carl Ingalls and Jacques Werth*


Understanding the competition is more than just understanding your employer’s competition.  What about *your* competition?



Who are these people that are taking sales away from you?  Is it the person who out\-persuades you, or is it the person who always manages to get to the best prospects before you do?  Is it the person who is friendlier than you, or is it the person who somehow gets trust and respect?



We don’t teach how to be more persuasive or how to act friendlier.  We teach how to do what the most successful salespeople do.
