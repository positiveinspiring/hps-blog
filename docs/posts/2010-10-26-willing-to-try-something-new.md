At the end of one of my training workshops on High Probability Selling (HPS), I asked the participants what they were going to do with what they had learned.  After some discussion, one of them asked another what she was going to do.


She answered, “I’m going to use High Probability Selling for one month.  I’ll compare my sales volume with the average of my previous twelve months.  If I come close to that average by just taking one course in HPS, I’ll keep using it and I’ll take the course over again.  If not, I’ll go back to the way I was selling before.  The worst that can happen is that I will lose one month’s income.”


She was already a very successful Realtor before she took the course, but was looking for a way to increase her sales while reducing her work hours.  Her willingness to try new things is what led to the success she already had, and also to the new success she found with High Probability Selling.
